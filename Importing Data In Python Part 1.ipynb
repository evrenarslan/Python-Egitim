      "When _Manasses_ [1] set up a carved image in the house of the Lord, and\n",
      "built altars in the two courts of the house, to all the host of Heaven, and\n",
      "us'd inchantments and witchcraft, and familiar spirits, and for his great\n",
      "wickedness was invaded by the army of _Asserhadon_ King of _Assyria_, and\n",
      "carried captive to _Babylon_; the book of the Law was lost till the\n",
      "eighteenth year of his grandson _Josiah_. Then [2] _Hilkiah_ the High\n",
      "Priest, upon repairing the Temple, found it there: and the King lamented\n",
      "that their fathers had not done after the words of the book, and commanded\n",
      "that it should be read to the people, and caused the people to renew the\n",
      "holy covenant with God. This is the book of the Law now extant.\n",
      "\n",
      "When [3] _Shishak_ came out of _Egypt_ and spoil'd the temple, and brought\n",
      "_Judah_ into subjection to the monarchy of _Egypt_, (which was in the fifth\n",
      "year of _Rehoboam_) the _Jews_ continued under great troubles for about\n",
      "twenty years; being _without the true God, and without a teaching Priest,\n",
      "and without Law: and in those times there was no peace to him that went\n",
      "out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the\n",
      "inhabitants of the countries, and nation was destroyed of nation, and city\n",
      "of city, for God did vex them with all adversity_. But [4] when _Shishak_\n",
      "was dead, and _Egypt_ fell into troubles, _Judah_ had quiet ten years; and\n",
      "in that time _Asa_ built fenced cities in _Judah_, and got up an army of\n",
      "580000 men, with which, in the 15th year of his reign, he met and overcame\n",
      "_Zerah_ the _Ethiopian_, who had conquered _Egypt_ and _Lybia_, and\n",
      "_Troglodytica_, and came out with an army of 1000000 _Lybians_ and\n",
      "_Ethiopians_, to recover the countries conquered by _Sesac_. And after this\n",
      "victory [5] _Asa_ dethroned his mother for idolatry, and he renewed the\n",
      "Altar, and brought new vessels of gold and silver into the Temple; and he\n",
      "and the people entered into a new covenant to seek the Lord God of their\n",
      "fathers, upon pain of death to those who worshiped other Gods; and his son\n",
      "_Jehosaphat_ took away the high places, and in the third year of his reign\n",
      "sent some of his Princes, and of the Priests and Levites, to teach in the\n",
      "cities of _Judah_: and they had the book of the Law with them, and went\n",
      "about throughout all the cities of _Judah_, and taught the people. This is\n",
      "that book of the Law which was afterwards lost in the reign of _Manasses_,\n",
      "and found again in the reign of _Josiah_, and therefore it was written\n",
      "before the third year of _Jehosaphat_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same book of the Law was preserved and handed down to posterity by the\n",
      "_Samaritans_, and therefore was received by the ten Tribes before their\n",
      "captivity. For [6] when the ten Tribes were captivated, a Priest or the\n",
      "captivity was sent back to _Bethel_, by order of the King of _Assyria_, to\n",
      "instruct the new inhabitants of _Samaria_, in _the manner of the God of the\n",
      "land_; and the _Samaritans_ had the _Pentateuch_ from this Priest, as\n",
      "containing the law or _manner of the God of the land_, which he was to\n",
      "teach them. For [7] they persevered in the religion which he taught them,\n",
      "joining with it the worship of their own Gods; and by persevering in what\n",
      "they had been taught, they preserved this book of their Law in the original\n",
      "character of the _Hebrews_, while the two Tribes, after their return from\n",
      "_Babylon_, changed the character to that of the _Chaldees_, which they had\n",
      "learned at _Babylon_.\n",
      "\n",
      "And since the _Pentateuch_ was received as the book of the Law, both by the\n",
      "two Tribes and by the ten Tribes, it follows that they received it before\n",
      "they became divided into two Kingdoms. For after the division, they\n",
      "received not laws from one another, but continued at variance. _Judah_\n",
      "could not reclaim _Israel_ from the sin of _Jeroboam_, and _Israel_ could\n",
      "not bring _Judah_ to it. The _Pentateuch_ therefore was the book of the Law\n",
      "in the days of _David_ and _Solomon_. The affairs of the Tabernacle and\n",
      "Temple were ordered by _David_ and _Solomon_, according to the Law of this\n",
      "book; and _David_ in the 78th Psalm, admonishing the people to give ear to\n",
      "the Law of God, means the Law of this book. For in describing how their\n",
      "forefathers kept it not, he quotes many historical things out of the books\n",
      "of _Exodus_ and _Numbers_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The race of the Kings of _Edom_, before there reigned any King over\n",
      "_Israel_, is set down in the book of [8] _Genesis_; and therefore that book\n",
      "was not written entirely in the form now extant, before the reign of\n",
      "_Saul_. The writer set down the race of those Kings till his own time, and\n",
      "therefore wrote before _David_ conquered _Edom_. The _Pentateuch_ is\n",
      "composed of the Law and the history of God's people together; and the\n",
      "history hath been collected from several books, such as were the history of\n",
      "the Creation composed by _Moses_, _Gen_. ii. 4. the book of the generations\n",
      "of _Adam_, _Gen._ v. i. and the book of the wars of the Lord, _Num._ xxi.\n",
      "14. This book of wars contained what was done at the Red-sea, and in the\n",
      "journeying of _Israel_ thro' the Wilderness, and therefore was begun by\n",
      "_Moses_. And _Joshua_ might carry it on to the conquest of _Canaan_. For\n",
      "_Joshua_ wrote some things in the book of the Law of God, _Josh._ xxiv. 26\n",
      "and therefore might write his own wars in the book of wars, those being the\n",
      "principal wars of God. These were publick books, and therefore not written\n",
      "without the authority of _Moses_ and _Joshua_. And _Samuel_ had leisure in\n",
      "the reign of _Saul_, to put them into the form of the books of _Moses_ and\n",
      "_Joshua_ now extant, inserting into the book of _Genesis_, the race of the\n",
      "Kings of _Edom_, until there reigned a King in _Israel_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book of the _Judges_ is a continued history of the _Judges_ down to the\n",
      "death of _Sampson_, and therefore was compiled after his death, out of the\n",
      "Acts of the _Judges_. Several things in this book are said to be done _when\n",
      "there was no King in _Israel__, _Judg._ xvii. 6. xviii. 1. xix. 1. xxi. 25.\n",
      "and therefore this book was written after the beginning of the reign of\n",
      "_Saul_. When it was written, the _Jebusites_ dwelt in _Jerusalem_, _Jud._\n",
      "i. 21 and therefore it was written before the eighth year of _David_, 2\n",
      "_Sam._ v. 8. and 1 _Chron._ xi. 6. The books of _Moses_, _Joshua_, and\n",
      "_Judges_, contain one continued history, down from the Creation to the\n",
      "death of _Sampson_. Where the _Pentateuch_ ends, the book of _Joshua_\n",
      "begins; and where the book of _Joshua_ ends, the book of _Judges_ begins.\n",
      "Therefore all these books have been composed out of the writings of\n",
      "_Moses_, _Joshua_, and other records, by one and the same hand, after the\n",
      "beginning of the reign of _Saul_, and before the eighth year of _David_.\n",
      "And _Samuel_ was a sacred writer, 1 _Sam._ x. 25. acquainted with the\n",
      "history of _Moses_ and the _Judges_, 1 _Sam._ xii. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and\n",
      "had leisure in the reign of _Saul_, and sufficient authority to compose\n",
      "these books. He was a Prophet, and judged _Israel_ all the days of his\n",
      "life, and was in the greatest esteem with the people; and the Law by which\n",
      "he was to judge the people was not to be published by less authority than\n",
      "his own, the Law-maker being not inferior to the judge. And the book of\n",
      "_Jasher_, which is quoted in the book of _Joshua_, _Josh._ x. 13. was in\n",
      "being at the death of _Saul_, 2 _Sam._ i. 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the dedication of the Temple of _Solomon_, when the Ark was brought into\n",
      "the most holy place, there was nothing in it but the two tables, 1 _Kings_\n",
      "viii. 9. and therefore when the _Philistines_ took the Ark, they took out\n",
      "of it the book of the Law, and the golden pot of Manna, and _Aaron_'s Rod.\n",
      "And this and other losses in the desolation of _Israel_, by the conquering\n",
      "_Philistines_, might give occasion to _Samuel_, after some respite from\n",
      "those enemies, to recollect the scattered writings of _Moses_ and _Joshua_,\n",
      "and the records of the Patriarchs and Judges, and compose them in the form\n",
      "now extant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book of _Ruth_ is a history of things done in the days of the _Judges_,\n",
      "and may be looked upon as an addition to the book of the _Judges_, written\n",
      "by the same author, and at the same time. For it was written after the\n",
      "birth of _David_, _Ruth_ iv. 17, 22. and not long after, because the\n",
      "history of _Boaz_ and _Ruth_, the great grandfather and great grandmother\n",
      "of _David_, and that of their contemporaries, could not well be remembered\n",
      "above two or three generations. And since this book derives the genealogy\n",
      "of _David_ from _Boaz_ and _Ruth_, and omits _David_'s elder brothers and\n",
      "his sons; it was written in honour of _David_, after he was anointed King\n",
      "by _Samuel_, and before he had children in _Hebron_, and by consequence in\n",
      "the reign of _Saul_. It proceeds not to the history of _David_, and\n",
      "therefore seems to have been written presently after he was anointed. They\n",
      "judge well therefore who ascribe to _Samuel_ the books of _Joshua_,\n",
      "_Judges_, and _Ruth_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Samuel_ is also reputed the author of the first book of _Samuel_, till the\n",
      "time of his death. The two books of _Samuel_ cite no authors, and therefore\n",
      "seem to be originals. They begin with his genealogy, birth and education,\n",
      "and might be written partly in his lifetime by himself or his disciples the\n",
      "Prophets at _Naioth_ in _Ramah_, 1 _Sam._ xix. 18, 19, 20. and partly after\n",
      "his death by the same disciples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The books of the _Kings_ cite other authors, as the book of the Acts of\n",
      "_Solomon_, the book of the _Chronicles_ of the Kings of _Israel_, and the\n",
      "book of the _Chronicles_ of the Kings of _Judah_. The books of the\n",
      "_Chronicles_ cite the book of _Samuel_ the Seer, the book of _Nathan_ the\n",
      "Prophet, and the book of _Gad_ the Seer, for the Acts of _David_; the book\n",
      "of _Nathan_ the Prophet, the Prophecy of _Ahijah_ the _Shilonite_, and the\n",
      "visions of _Iddo_ the Seer, for the Acts of _Solomon_; the book of\n",
      "_Shemajah_ the Prophet, and the book of _Iddo_ the Seer concerning\n",
      "genealogies, for the Acts of _Rehoboam_ and _Abijah_; the book of the Kings\n",
      "of _Judah_ and _Israel_ for the Acts of _Asa_, _Joash_, _Amaziah_,\n",
      "_Jotham_, _Ahaz_, _Hezekiah_, _Manasseh_, and _Josiah_; the book of\n",
      "_Hanani_ the Seer, for the Acts of _Jehosaphat_; and the visions of\n",
      "_Isaiah_ for the Acts of _Uzziah_ and _Hezekiah_. These books were\n",
      "therefore collected out of the historical writings of the antient Seers and\n",
      "Prophets. And because the books of the _Kings_ and _Chronicles_ quote one\n",
      "another, they were written at one and the same time. And this time was\n",
      "after the return from the _Babylonian_ captivity, because they bring down\n",
      "the history of _Judah_, and the genealogies of the Kings of _Judah_, and of\n",
      "the High Priests, to that captivity. The book of _Ezra_ was originally a\n",
      "part of the book of the _Chronicles_, and has been divided from it. For it\n",

      "taken from the analogy between the world natural, and an empire or kingdom\n",

      "Accordingly, the whole world natural consisting of heaven and earth,\n",

      "much of it as is considered in the Prophecy: and the things in that world\n",
      "signify the analogous things in this. For the heavens, and the things\n",
      "therein, signify thrones and dignities, and those who enjoy them; and the\n",
      "earth, with the things thereon, the inferior people; and the lowest parts\n",
      "of the earth, called _Hades_ or Hell, the lowest or most miserable part of\n",
      "them. Whence ascending towards heaven, and descending to the earth, are put\n",
      "for rising and falling in power and honour: rising out of the earth, or\n",
      "waters, and falling into them, for the rising up to any dignity or\n",
      "dominion, out of the inferior state of the people, or falling down from the\n",
      "same into that inferior state; descending into the lower parts of the\n",
      "earth, for descending to a very low and unhappy estate; speaking with a\n",
      "faint voice out of the dust, for being in a weak and low condition; moving\n",
      "from one place to another, for translation from one office, dignity, or\n",
      "dominion, to another; great earthquakes, and the shaking of heaven and\n",
      "earth, for the shaking of kingdoms, so as to distract or overthrow them;\n",
      "the creating a new heaven and earth, and the passing away of an old one, or\n",

      "The third Beast was the kingdom which succeeded the _Persian_; and this was\n",
      "the empire of the _Greeks_, _Dan._ viii. 6, 7, 20, 21. It was _like a\n",

      "_Gunderic_ King of the _Vandals_ in _Boetica_, and went afterwards with\n",

      "expected to be heard, the Council declared [11] that he who was the supreme\n",
      "judge of all men, was above being judged by any other than himself:\n",
      "whereupon he made a solemn declaration of his innocence before all the\n",
      "people, and by doing so was looked upon as acquitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after, upon _Christmas_-day, the people of _Rome_, who had hitherto\n",
      "elected their Bishop, and reckoned that they and their Senate inherited the\n",
      "rights of the antient Senate and people of _Rome_, voted _Charles_ their\n",
      "Emperor, and subjected themselves to him in such manner as the old _Roman_\n",
      "Empire and their Senate were subjected to the old _Roman_ Emperors. The\n",
      "Pope crowned him, and anointed him with holy oil, and worshipped him on his\n",

      "aforesaid Poet thus relates:\n",

      "The Emperor, on the other hand, took the following oath to the Pope: _In\n",

      "EcclesiÃ¦ in omnibus utilitatibus, quatenÃ¹s divino fultus fuero adjutorio,\n",
      "prout sciero poteroque_. The Emperor was also made Consul of _Rome_, and\n",
      "his son _Pipin_ crowned King of _Italy_: and henceforward the Emperor\n",
      "stiled himself: _Carolus serenissimus, Augustus, Ã  Deo coronatus, magnus,\n",
      "pacificus, RomÃ¦ gubernans imperium_, or _Imperator Romanorum_; and was\n",
      "prayed for in the Churches of _Rome_. His image was henceforward put upon\n",
      "the coins of _Rome_: while the enemies of the Pope, to the number of three\n",
      "hundred _Romans_ and two or three of the Clergy, were sentenced to death.\n",
      "The three hundred _Romans_ were beheaded in one day in the _Lateran_\n",
      "fields: but the Clergymen at the intercession of the Pope were pardoned,\n",
      "and banished into _France_. And thus the title of _Roman_ Emperor, which\n",
      "had hitherto been in the _Greek_ Emperors, was by this act transferred in\n",
      "the _West_ to the Kings of _France_.\n",
      "\n",

      "in ordering the affairs of _Rome_, and those of the Apostolic see, and of\n",
      "all _Italy_, both civil and ecclesiastical, and in making new laws for\n",
      "them; and returned the next summer into _France_: leaving the city under\n",
      "its Senate, and both under the Pope and himself. But hearing that his new\n",
      "laws were not observed by the judges in dictating the law, nor by the\n",
      "people in hearing it; and that the great men took servants from free men,\n",
      "and from the Churches and Monasteries, to labour in their vineyards,\n",
      "fields, pastures and houses, and continued to exact cattle and wine of\n",
      "them, and to oppress those that served the Churches: he wrote to his son\n",

      "Now the Senate and people and principality of _Rome_ I take to be the third\n",

      "people elected the Pope and the Emperor; and now, by electing the Emperor\n",
      "and making him Consul, was acknowledged to retain the authority of the old\n",
      "_Roman_ Senate and people. This city was the Metropolis of the old _Roman_\n",
      "Empire, represented in _Daniel_ by the fourth Beast; and by subduing the\n",
      "Senate and people and Duchy, it became the Metropolis of the little horn of\n",
      "that Beast, and completed _Peter_'s Patrimony, which was the kingdom of\n",
      "that horn. Besides, this victory was attended with greater consequences\n",
      "than those over the other two Kings. For it set up the _Western Empire_,\n",
      "which continues to this day. It set up the Pope above the judicature of the\n",
      "_Roman_ Senate, and above that of a Council of _Italian_ and _French_\n",
      "Bishops, and even above all human judicature; and gave him the supremacy\n",
      "over the _Western_ Churches and their Councils in a high degree. It gave\n",
      "him _a look more stout than his fellows_; so that when this new religion\n",
      "began to be established in the minds of men, he grappled not only with\n",
      "Kings, but even with the _Western_ Emperor himself. It is observable also,\n",
      "that the custom of kissing the Pope's feet, an honour superior to that of\n",
      "Kings and Emperors, began about this time. There are some instances of it\n",
      "in the ninth century: _Platina_ tells us, that the feet of Pope _Leo_ IV\n",
      "were kissed, according to antient custom, by all who came to him: and some\n",
      "say that _Leo_ III began this custom, pretending that his hand was infected\n",
      "by the kiss of a woman. The Popes began also about this time to canonize\n",
      "saints, and to grant indulgences and pardons: and some represent that _Leo_\n",
      "III was the first author of all these things. It is further observable,\n",
      "that _Charles_ the great, between the years 775 and 796, conquered all\n",
      "_Germany_ from the _Rhine_ and _Danube_ northward to the _Baltic_ sea, and\n",
      "eastward to the river _Teis_; extending his conquests also into _Spain_ as\n",
      "far as the river _Ebro_: and by these conquests he laid the foundation of\n",
      "the new Empire; and at the same time propagated the _Roman_ Catholic\n",
      "religion into all his conquests, obliging the _Saxons_ and _Hunns_ who were\n",
      "heathens, to receive the _Roman_ faith, and distributing his northern\n",
      "conquests into Bishopricks, granting tithes to the Clergy and _Peter-pence_\n",
      "to the Pope: by all which the Church of _Rome_ was highly enlarged,\n",
      "enriched, exalted, and established.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the forementioned _dissertation upon some coins of _Charles_ the great,\n",
      "_Ludovicus Pius_, _Lotharius_, and their successors, stamped at _Rome__,\n",
      "there is a draught of a piece of _Mosaic_ work which Pope _Leo_ III. caused\n",
      "to be made in his Palace near the Church of _John Lateran_, in memory of\n",
      "his sending the standard or banner of the city of _Rome_ curiously wrought,\n",
      "to _Charles_ the great; and which still remained there at the publishing of\n",
      "the said book. In the _Mosaic_ work there appeared _Peter_ with three keys\n",
      "in his lap, reaching the _Pallium_ to the Pope with his right hand, and the\n",
      "banner of the city to _Charles_ the great with his left. By the Pope was\n",

      "REGI; and under the feet of _Peter_ this, BEATE PETRE, DONA VITAM LEONI PP,\n",
      "ET BICTORIAM CARVLO REGI DONA. This Monument gives the title of King to\n",
      "_Charles_, and therefore was erected before he was Emperor. It was erected\n",
      "when _Peter_ was reaching the _Pallium_ to the Pope, and the Pope was\n",
      "sending the banner of the city to _Charles_, that is, A.C. 796. The words\n",
      "above, _Sanctissimus Dominus noster Leo Papa Domino nostro Carolo Regi_,\n",
      "relate to the message; and the words below, _Beate Petre, dona vitam Leoni\n",
      "PapÃ¦ & victoriam Carolo regi dona_, are a prayer that in this undertaking\n",
      "God would preserve the life of the Pope, and give victory to the King over\n",
      "the _Romans_. The three keys in the lap of _Peter_ signify the keys of the\n",
      "three parts of his Patrimony, that of _Rome_ with its Duchy, which the Pope\n",
      "claimed and was conquering, those of _Ravenna_ with the Exarchate, and of\n",
      "the territories taken from the _Lombards_; both which he had newly\n",
      "conquered. These were the three dominions, whose keys were in the lap of\n",
      "St. _Peter_, and whose Crowns are now worn by the Pope, and by the conquest\n",
      "of which he became the little horn of the fourth Beast. By _Peter_'s giving\n",

      "to the King with his left, and by naming the Pope before the King in the\n",

      "_Of the kingdoms represented in _Daniel_ by the Ram and He-Goat_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second and third Empires, represented by the Bear and Leopard, are\n",
      "again represented by the Ram and He-Goat; but with this difference, that\n",
      "the Ram represents the kingdoms of the _Medes_ and _Persians_ from the\n",
      "beginning of the four Empires, and the Goat represents the kingdom of the\n",
      "_Greeks_ to the end of them. By this means, under the type of the Ram and\n",
      "He-Goat, the times of all the four Empires are again described: _I lifted\n",
      "up mine eyes_, saith [1] _Daniel_, _and saw_, _and behold there stood\n",
      "before the river_ [Ulai] _a Ram which had two horns, and the two horns were\n",
      "high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.--And\n",
      "the Ram having two horns, are the kings of _Media_ and _Persia__: not two\n",
      "persons but two kingdoms, the kingdoms of _Media_ and _Persia_; and the\n",
      "kingdom of _Persia_ was the higher horn and came up last. The kingdom of\n",
      "_Persia_ rose up, when _Cyrus_ having newly conquered _Babylon_, revolted\n",
      "from _Darius_ King of the _Medes_, and beat him at _PasargadÃ¦_, and set up\n",
      "the _Persians_ above the _Medes_. This was the horn which came up last. And\n",
      "the horn which came up first was the kingdom of the _Medes_, from the time\n",
      "that _Cyaxares_ and _Nebuchadnezzar_ overthrew _Nineveh_, and shared the\n",
      "Empire of the _Assyrians_ between them. The Empires of _Media_ and\n",
      "_Babylon_ were contemporary, and rose up together by the fall of the\n",
      "_Assyrian_ Empire; and the Prophecy of the four Beasts begins with one of\n",
      "them, and that of the Ram and He-Goat with the other. As the Ram represents\n",
      "the kingdom of _Media_ and _Persia_ from the beginning of the four Empires;\n",
      "so the He-Goat represents the Empire of the _Greeks_ to the end of those\n",
      "Monarchies. In the reign of his great horn, and of the four horns which\n",
      "succeeded it, he represents this Empire during the reign of the Leopard:\n",
      "and in the reign of his little horn, which stood up in the latter time of\n",
      "the kingdom of the four, and after their fall became mighty but not by his\n",
      "own power, he represents it during the reign of the fourth Beast.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The rough Goat_, saith _Daniel, is the King of_ Grecia, that is, the\n",
      "kingdom; _and the great horn between his eyes is the first King_: not the\n",
      "first Monarch, but the first kingdom, that which lasted during the reign of\n",
      "_Alexander_ the great, and his brother _AridÃ¦us_ and two young sons,\n",
      "_Alexander_ and _Hercules_. [2] _Now that_ [horn] _being broken off,\n",
      "whereas four_ [horns] _stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of\n",
      "the nation_ [of the _Greeks_], _but not in his_ [the first horn's] _power_.\n",
      "The four horns are therefore four kingdoms; and by consequence, the first\n",
      "great horn which they succeeded is the first great kingdom of the _Greeks_,\n",
      "that which was founded by _Alexander_ the great, _An. Nabonass._ 414, and\n",
      "lasted till the death of his son _Hercules_, _An. Nabonass._ 441. And the\n",
      "four are those of _Cassander_, _Lysimachus_, _Antigonus_, and _Ptolemy_, as\n",
      "above.\n",
      "\n",
      "[3] _And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are\n",
      "come to the full, a King_ [or new kingdom] _of fierce countenance, and\n",
      "understanding dark sentences, shall stand up: and his power shall be\n",
      "mighty, but not by his own power_. This King was the last horn of the Goat,\n",
      "the little horn which came up out of one of the four horns, and waxed\n",
      "exceeding great. The latter time of their kingdom was when the _Romans_\n",
      "began to conquer them, that is, when they conquered _Perseus_ King of\n",
      "_Macedonia_, the fundamental kingdom of the _Greeks_. And at that time the\n",
      "transgressors came to the full: for then the High-priesthood was exposed to\n",
      "sale, the Vessels of the Temple were sold to pay for the purchase; and the\n",
      "High-priest, with some of the _Jews_, procured a licence from _Antiochus\n",
      "Epiphanes_ to do after the ordinances of the heathen, and set up a school\n",
      "at _Jerusalem_ for teaching those ordinances. Then _Antiochus_ took\n",
      "_Jerusalem_ with an armed force, slew 4000 _Jews_, took as many prisoners\n",
      "and sold them, spoiled the Temple, interdicted the worship, commanded the\n",
      "Law of _Moses_ to be burnt, and set up the worship of the heathen Gods in\n",
      "all _Judea_. In the very same year, _An. Nabonass._ 580, the _Romans_\n",
      "conquered _Macedonia_, the chief of the four horns. Hitherto the Goat was\n",
      "mighty by its own power, but henceforward began to be under the _Romans_.\n",
      "_Daniel_ distinguishes the times, by describing very particularly the\n",
      "actions of the Kings of the north and south, those two of the four horns\n",
      "which bordered upon _Judea_, until the _Romans_ conquered _Macedonia_; and\n",
      "thenceforward only touching upon the main revolutions which happened within\n",
      "the compass of the nations represented by the Goat. In this latter period\n",
      "of time the little horn was to stand up and grow mighty, but not by his own\n",
      "power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three first of _Daniel_'s Beasts had their dominions taken away, each\n",
      "of them at the rise of the next Beast; but their lives were prolonged, and\n",
      "they are all of them still alive. The third Beast, or Leopard, reigned in\n",
      "his four heads, till the rise of the fourth Beast, or Empire of the\n",
      "_Latins_; and his life was prolonged under their power. This Leopard\n",
      "reigning in his four heads, signifies the same thing with the He-Goat\n",
      "reigning in his four horns: and therefore the He-Goat reigned in his four\n",
      "horns till the rise of _Daniel_'s fourth Beast, or Empire of the _Latins_:\n",
      "then its dominion was taken away by the _Latins_, but its life was\n",
      "prolonged under their power. The _Latins_ are not comprehended among the\n",
      "nations represented by the He-Goat in this Prophecy: their power over the\n",
      "_Greeks_ is only named in it, to distinguish the times in which the He-Goat\n",
      "was mighty by his own power, from the times in which he was mighty but not\n",
      "by his own power. He was mighty by his own power till his dominion was\n",
      "taken away by the _Latins_; after that, his life was prolonged under their\n",
      "dominion, and this prolonging of his life was in the days of his last horn:\n",
      "for in the days of this horn the Goat became mighty, but not by his own\n",
      "power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now because this horn was a horn of the Goat, we are to look for it among\n",
      "the nations which composed the body of the Goat. Among those nations he was\n",
      "to rise up and grow mighty: he grew mighty [4] _towards the south, and\n",
      "towards the east, and towards the pleasant land_; and therefore he was to\n",
      "rise up in the north-west parts of those nations, and extend his dominion\n",
      "towards _Egypt_, _Syria_ and _Judea_. In the latter time of the kingdom of\n",
      "the four horns, it was to rise up out of one of them and subdue the rest,\n",
      "but not by its own power. It was to be assisted by a foreign power, a power\n",
      "superior to itself, the power which took away the dominion of the third\n",
      "Beast, the power of the fourth Beast. And such a little horn was the\n",
      "kingdom of _Macedonia_, from the time that it became subject to the\n",
      "_Romans_. This kingdom, by the victory of the _Romans_ over _Persius_ King\n",
      "of _Macedonia_, _Anno Nabonass._ 580, ceased to be one of the four horns of\n",
      "the Goat, and became a dominion of a new sort: not a horn of the fourth\n",
      "Beast, for _Macedonia_ belonged to the body of the third; but a horn of the\n",
      "third Beast of a new sort, a horn of the Goat which grew mighty but not by\n",
      "his own power, a horn which rose up and grew potent under a foreign power,\n",
      "the power of the _Romans_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Romans_, by the legacy of _Attalus_ the last King of _Pergamus_, _An.\n",
      "Nabonass._ 615, inherited that kingdom, including all _Asia Minor_ on this\n",
      "side mount _Taurus_. _An. Nabonass._ 684 and 685 they conquered _Armenia_,\n",
      "_Syria_ and _Judea_; _An. Nabonass._ 718, they subdued _Egypt_. And by\n",
      "these conquests the little horn [5] _waxed exceeding great towards the\n",
      "south, and towards the east, and towards the pleasant land. And it waxed\n",
      "great even to the host of heaven; and cast down some of the host and of the\n",
      "stars to the ground, and stamped upon them_, that is, upon the people and\n",
      "great men of the _Jews_. [6] _Yea, he magnified himself even to the Prince\n",
      "of the Host_, the _Messiah_, the Prince of the _Jews_, whom he put to\n",
      "death, _An. Nabonass._ 780. _And by him the daily sacrifice was taken away,\n",
      "and the place of his sanctuary was cast down_, viz. in the wars which the\n",
      "armies of the _Eastern_ nations under the conduct of the _Romans_ made\n",
      "against _Judea_, when _Nero_ and _Vespasian_ were Emperors, _An. Nabonass._\n",
      "816, 817, 818. [7] _And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice\n",
      "by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground, and\n",
      "it practised and prospered_. This transgression is in the next words called\n",
      "_the transgression of desolation_; and in _Dan._ xi. 31. _the abomination\n",
      "which maketh desolate_; and in _Matth._ xxiv. 15. _the abomination of\n",
      "desolation, spoken of by _Daniel_ the prophet, standing in the holy place_.\n",
      "It may relate chiefly to the worship of _Jupiter Olympius_ in his Temple\n",
      "built by the Emperor _Hadrian_, in the place of the Temple of the _Jews_,\n",
      "and to the revolt of the _Jews_ under _Barchochab_ occasioned thereby, and\n",
      "to the desolation of _Judea_ which followed thereupon; all the _Jews_,\n",
      "being thenceforward banished _Judea_ upon pain of death. _Then I heard_,\n",
      "saith [8] _Daniel, one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that\n",
      "certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the\n",
      "daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the\n",
      "sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto me, Unto\n",
      "two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed._\n",
      "_Daniel_'s days are years; and these years may perhaps be reckoned either\n",
      "from the destruction of the Temple by the _Romans_ in the reign of\n",
      "_Vespasian_, or from the pollution of the Sanctuary by the worship of\n",
      "_Jupiter Olympius_, or from the desolation of _Judea_ made in the end of\n",
      "the _Jewish_ war by the banishment of all the _Jews_ out of their own\n",
      "country, or from some other period which time will discover. Henceforward\n",
      "the last horn of the Goat continued mighty under the _Romans_, till the\n",
      "reign of _Constantine_ the great and his sons: and then by the division of\n",
      "the _Roman_ Empire between the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Emperors, it separated\n",
      "from the _Latins_, and became the _Greek_ Empire alone, but yet under the\n",
      "dominion of a _Roman_ family; and at present it is mighty under the\n",
      "dominion of the _Turks_.\n",
      "\n",
      "This last horn is by some taken for _Antiochus Epiphanes_, but not very\n",
      "judiciously. A horn of a Beast is never taken for a single person: it\n",
      "always signifies a new kingdom, and the kingdom of _Antiochus_ was an old\n",
      "one. _Antiochus_ reigned over one of the four horns, and the little horn\n",
      "was a fifth under its proper kings. This horn was at first a little one,\n",
      "and waxed exceeding great, but so did not _Antiochus_. It is described\n",
      "great above all the former horns, and so was not _Antiochus_. His kingdom\n",
      "on the contrary was weak, and tributary to the _Romans_, and he did not\n",
      "enlarge it. The horn was a _King of fierce countenance, and destroyed\n",
      "wonderfully, and prospered and practised_; that is, he prospered in his\n",
      "practises against the holy people: but _Antiochus_ was frighted out of\n",
      "_Egypt_ by a mere message of the _Romans_, and afterwards routed and\n",
      "baffled by the _Jews_. The horn was mighty by another's power, _Antiochus_\n",
      "acted by his own. The horn stood up against the Prince of the Host of\n",
      "heaven, the Prince of Princes; and this is the character not of _Antiochus_\n",
      "but of _Antichrist_. The horn cast down the Sanctuary to the ground, and so\n",
      "did not _Antiochus_; he left it standing. The Sanctuary and Host were\n",
      "trampled under foot 2300 days; and in _Daniel_'s Prophecies days are put\n",
      "for years: but the profanation of the Temple in the reign of _Antiochus_\n",
      "did not last so many natural days. These were to last till the time of the\n",
      "end, till the last end of the indignation against the _Jews_; and this\n",
      "indignation is not yet at an end. They were to last till the Sanctuary\n",
      "which had been cast down should be cleansed, and the Sanctuary is not yet\n",
      "cleansed.\n",

      "_viz_. _Egypt_ and _Syria_, calling them the Kings of the _South_ and\n",
      "_North_, that is, in respect of _Judea_; and he carries on the description\n",

      "set up the heathen Gods in all _Judea_, and the _Romans_ conquered the\n",
      "kingdom of _Macedon_; the prophetic Angel leaves off describing the affairs\n",

      "after him Arms_ [the _Romans_] _shall stand up, and they shall pollute the\n",

      "where in these Prophecies of _Daniel_ put for the military power of a\n",
      "kingdom, and they stand up when they conquer and grow powerful. The\n",
      "_Romans_ conquered _Illyricum_, _Epirus_ and _Macedonia_, in the year of\n",

      "_Syria_, and reduced it into a Province: and thirty four years after they\n",
      "did the like to _Egypt_. By all these steps the _Roman_ arms stood up over\n",
      "the _Greeks_. And after 95 years more, by making war upon the _Jews, they\n",
      "polluted the sanctuary of strength, and took away the daily sacrifice,\n",

      "_Matth._ xxiv. 15. In the 16th year of the Emperor _Hadrian_, A. C. 132,\n",
      "they placed this abomination by building a Temple to _Jupiter Capitolinus_,\n",
      "where the Temple of God in _Jerusalem_ had stood. Thereupon the _Jews_\n",

      "_Son of man_, by the _Prince of the host_, and the _Prince of Princes_. The\n",
      "Prophecy of the _Son of man_ coming in the clouds of heaven relates to the\n",
      "second coming of _Christ_; that of the _Prince of the host_ relates to his\n",
      "first coming: and this Prophecy of the _Messiah_, in explaining them,\n",
      "relates to both comings, and assigns the times thereof.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Prophecy, like all the rest of _Daniel_'s, consists of two parts, an\n",

      "first coming only, as Interpreters usually do. We avoid also the doing\n",
      "violence to the language of _Daniel_, by taking the _seven weeks_ and\n",

      "they place _Ezra_ and _Nehemiah_ in the reign of _Artaxerxes Mnemon_, and\n",

      "the first age. They who began first to celebrate them, placed them in the\n",

      "the 25th of _March_, which when _Julius CÃ¦sar_ corrected the Calendar was\n",
      "the vernal Equinox; the feast of _John_ Baptist on the 24th of _June_,\n",
      "which was the summer Solstice; the feast of St. _Michael_ on _Sept._ 29,\n",
      "which was the autumnal Equinox; and the birth of _Christ_ on the winter\n",
      "Solstice, _Decemb._ 25, with the feasts of St. _Stephen_, St. _John_ and\n",
      "the _Innocents_, as near it as they could place them. And because the\n",
      "Solstice in time removed from the 25th of _December_ to the 24th, the 23d,\n",
      "the 22d, and so on backwards, hence some in the following centuries placed\n",
      "the birth of _Christ_ on _Decemb._ 23, and at length on _Decemb._ 20: and\n",
      "for the same reason they seem to have set the feast of St. _Thomas_ on\n",
      "_Decemb._ 21, and that of St. _Matthew_ on _Sept._ 21. So also at the\n",

      "_Eusebius_ discovered four successive Passovers in the Gospel of _John_,\n",

      "harvest, _John_ iv. 35. that is, about the time of the winter Solstice. For\n",
      "their harvest was between _Easter_ and _Whitsunday_, and began about a\n",

      "and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest_; meaning,\n",
      "that the people in the fields were ready for the Gospel, as his next words\n",
      "shew[1]. _John_ therefore was imprisoned about _November_, in the 17th year\n",
      "of _Tiberius_; and _Christ_ thereupon went from _Judea_ to _Cana_ of\n",
      "_Galilee_ in _December_, and was received there of the _Galileans_, who had\n",
      "seen all he did at _Jerusalem_ at the Passover: and when a Nobleman of\n",

      "\n",
      "From this time therefore _Jesus_ taught in the Synagogues of _Galilee_ on\n",

      "\n",
      "All this time _Matthew_ passeth over in few words, and here begins to\n",

      "past before the preaching of that sermon. The multitudes that followed him\n",
      "from _Jerusalem_ and _Judea_, shew that he had lately been there at the\n",
      "feast. The sermon in the mount was made when great multitudes came to him\n",
      "from all places, and followed him in the open fields; which is an argument\n",
      "of the summer-season: and in this sermon he pointed at the lilies of the\n",

      "In the first ages of the Christian religion the Christians of every city\n",
      "were governed by a Council of Presbyters, and the President of the Council\n",
      "was the Bishop of the city. The Bishop and Presbyters of one city meddled\n",
      "not with the affairs of another city, except by admonitory letters or\n",
      "messages. Nor did the Bishops of several cities meet together in Council\n",
      "before the time of the Emperor _Commodus_: for they could not meet together\n",
      "without the leave of the _Roman_ governors of the Provinces. But in the\n",
      "days of that Emperor they began to meet in Provincial Councils, by the\n",
      "leave of the governors; first in _Asia_, in opposition to the\n",
      "_Cataphrygian_ Heresy, and soon after in other places and upon other\n",
      "occasions. The Bishop of the chief city, or Metropolis of the _Roman_\n",
      "Province, was usually made President of the Council; and hence came the\n",
      "authority of Metropolitan Bishops above that of other Bishops within the\n",
      "same Province. Hence also it was that the Bishop of _Rome_ in _Cyprian_'s\n",
      "days called himself the Bishop of Bishops. As soon as the Empire became\n",
      "Christian, the _Roman_ Emperors began to call general Councils out of all\n",
      "the Provinces of the Empire; and by prescribing to them what points they\n",
      "should consider, and influencing them by their interest and power, they set\n",
      "up what party they pleased. Hereby the _Greek_ Empire, upon the division of\n",
      "the _Roman_ Empire into the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires, became _the King\n",
      "who_, in matters of religion, _did according to his will_; _and_, in\n",
      "legislature, _exalted and magnified himself above every God_: and at\n",
      "length, by the seventh general Council, established the worship of the\n",
      "images and souls of dead men, here called _Mahuzzims_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same King placed holiness in abstinence from marriage. _Eusebius_ in\n",
      "his Ecclesiastical history [1] tells us, that _Musanus_ wrote a tract\n",
      "against those who fell away to the heresy of the _Encratites_, which was\n",
      "then newly risen, and had introduced pernicious errors; and that _Tatian_,\n",
      "the disciple of _Justin_, was the author thereof; and that _IrenÃ¦us_ in his\n",
      "first book against heresies teaches this, writing of _Tatian_ and his\n",

      "followers of _Tatian_ were at first condemned as hereticks by the name of\n",
      "_Encratites_, or _Continentes_; their principles could not be yet quite\n",
      "exploded: for _Montanus_ refined upon them, and made only second marriages\n",
      "unlawful; he also introduced frequent fastings, and annual, fasting days,\n",
      "the keeping of _Lent_, and feeding upon dried meats. The _Apostolici_,\n",
      "about the middle of the third century, condemned marriage, and were a\n",
      "branch of the disciples of _Tatian_. The _HierocitÃ¦_ in _Egypt_, in the\n",
      "latter end of the third century, also condemned marriage. _Paul_ the\n",
      "_Eremite_ fled into the wilderness from the persecution of _Decius_, and\n",
      "lived there a solitary life till the reign of _Constantine_ the great, but\n",
      "made no disciples. _Antony_ did the like in the persecution of\n",
      "_Dioclesian_, or a little before, and made disciples; and many others soon\n",
      "followed his example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitherto the principles of the _Encratites_ had been rejected by the\n",
      "Churches; but now being refined by the Monks, and imposed not upon all men,\n",
      "but only upon those who would voluntarily undertake a monastic life, they\n",
      "began to be admired, and to overflow first the _Greek_ Church, and then the\n",
      "_Latin_ also, like a torrent. _Eusebius_ tells us, [2] that _Constantine_\n",

      "wholly to the divine philosophy; and that he almost venerated the most holy\n",
      "company of Virgins perpetually devoted to God; being certain that the God\n",
      "to whom he had consecrated himself did dwell in their minds. In his time\n",

      "_Athanasius_ in his younger days poured water upon the hands of his master\n",

      "_Of the _Mahuzzims_, honoured by the King who doth according to his will_.\n",
      "\n",
      "In scripture we are told of some _trusting in God_ and others _trusting in\n",
      "idols_, and that _God is our refuge, our strength, our defense_. In this\n",
      "sense God is _the rock of his people_, and false Gods are called _the rock\n",
      "of those that trust in them_, Deut. xxxii. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37. In the\n",
      "same sense the Gods of _the King_ who _shall do according to his will_ are\n",
      "called _Mahuzzims_, munitions, fortresses, protectors, guardians, or\n",
      "defenders. _In his estate_, saith [1] _Daniel_, _shall he honour\n",
      "_Mahuzzims_; even with a God whom his fathers knew not, shall he honour\n",
      "them with gold and silver, and with precious stones, and things of value.\n",
      "Thus shall he do in the most strong holds_ or temples;--_and he shall cause\n",
      "them to rule over many, and divide the land_ among them _for a possession_.\n",
      "Now this came to pass by degrees in the following manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Gregory Nyssen_ [2] tells us, that after the persecution of the Emperor\n",
      "_Decius_, _Gregory_ Bishop of _NeocÃ¦sarea_ in _Pontus_, _instituted among\n",
      "all people, as an addition or corollary of devotion towards God, that\n",
      "festival days and assemblies should be celebrated to them who had contended\n",
      "for the faith_, that is, to the _Martyrs_. And he adds this reason for the\n",
      "institution: _When he observed_, saith _Nyssen_, _that the simple and\n",
      "unskilful multitude, by reason of corporeal delights, remained in the error\n",
      "of idols; that the principal thing might be corrected among them, namely,\n",
      "that instead of their vain worship they might turn their eyes upon God; he\n",
      "permitted that at the memories of the holy Martyrs they might make merry\n",
      "and delight themselves, and be dissolved into joy_. The heathens were\n",
      "delighted with the festivals of their Gods, and unwilling to part with\n",
      "those delights; and therefore _Gregory_, to facilitate their conversion,\n",
      "instituted annual festivals to the _Saints_ and _Martyrs_. Hence it came to\n",
      "pass, that for exploding the festivals of the heathens, the principal\n",
      "festivals of the _Christians_ succeeded in their room: as the keeping of\n",
      "_Christmas_ with ivy and feasting, and playing and sports, in the room of\n",
      "the _Bacchanalia_ and _Saturnalia_; the celebrating of _May-day_ with\n",
      "flowers, in the room of the _Floralia_; and the keeping of festivals to the\n",
      "Virgin _Mary_, _John_ the Baptist, and divers of the Apostles, in the room\n",
      "of the solemnities at the entrance of the Sun into the signs of the\n",
      "_Zodiac_ in the old _Julian_ Calendar. In the same persecution of _Decius_,\n",
      "_Cyprian_ ordered the passions of the Martyrs in _Africa_ to be registred,\n",
      "in order to celebrate their memories annually with oblations and\n",
      "sacrifices: and _Felix_ Bishop of _Rome_, a little after, as _Platina_\n",
      "relates, _Martyrum gloria consulens, constituit at quotannis sacrificia\n",
      "eorum nomine celebrarentur_; \"consulting the glory of the Martyrs, ordained\n",
      "that sacrifices should be celebrated annually in their name.\" By the\n",
      "pleasures of these festivals the _Christians_ increased much in number, and\n",
      "decreased as much in virtue, until they were _purged and made white_ by the\n",
      "persecution of _Dioclesian_. This was the first step made in the\n",
      "_Christian_ religion towards the veneration of the Martyrs: and tho it did\n",
      "not yet amount to an unlawful worship; yet it disposed the _Christians_\n",
      "towards such a further veneration of the dead, as in a short time ended in\n",
      "the invocation of Saints.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step was the affecting to pray at the sepulchres of the Martyrs:\n",
      "which practice began in _Dioclesian_'s persecution. The Council of\n",
      "_Eliberis_ in _Spain_, celebrated in the third or fourth year of\n",
      "_Dioclesian_'s persecution, A.C. 305, hath these Canons. Can. 34. _Cereos\n",
      "per diem placuit in Coemeterio non incendi: inquietandi enim spiritus\n",
      "sanctorum non sunt. Qui hÃ¦c non observÃ¢rint, arceantur ab EcclesiÃ¦\n",
      "communione._ Can. 35. _Placuit prohiberi ne fÃ¦minÃ¦ in Coemeterio\n",
      "pervigilent, eÃ² quod sÃ¦pe sub obtentu orationis latentÃ¨r scelera\n",
      "committant._ Presently after that persecution, suppose about the year 314,\n",
      "the Council of _Laodicea_ in _Phrygia_, which then met for restoring the\n",
      "lapsed discipline of the Church, has the following Canons. Can. 9. _Those\n",
      "of the Church are not allowed to go into the _Coemeteries_ or _Martyries_,\n",
      "as they are called, of hereticks, for the sake of prayer or recovery of\n",
      "health: but such as go, if they be of the faithful, shall be excommunicated\n",
      "for a time_. Can. 34. _A _Christian_ must not leave the Martyrs of\n",
      "_Christ_, and go to false Martyrs_, that is, to the Martyrs of the\n",
      "hereticks; _for these are alien from God: and therefore let those be\n",
      "anathema who go to them_. Can. 51. _The birth-days of the Martyrs shall not\n",
      "be celebrated in _Lent_, but their commemoration shall be made on the\n",
      "Sabbath-days and Lords days_. The Council of _Paphlagonia_, celebrated in\n",
      "the year 324, made this Canon: _If any man being arrogant, abominates the\n",
      "congregations of the Martyrs, or the Liturgies performed therein, or the\n",
      "memories of the Martyrs, let him be anathema_. By all which it is manifest\n",
      "that the _Christians_ in the time of _Dioclesian_'s persecution used to\n",
      "pray in the _Coemeteries_ or burying-places of the dead; for avoiding the\n",
      "danger of the persecution, and for want of Churches, which were all thrown\n",
      "down: and after the persecution was over, continued that practice in honour\n",
      "of the Martyrs, till new Churches could be built: and by use affected it as\n",
      "advantageous to devotion, and for recovering the health of those that were\n",
      "sick. It also appears that in these burying-places they commemorated the\n",
      "Martyrs yearly upon days dedicated to them, and accounted all these\n",
      "practices pious and religious, and anathematized those men as arrogant who\n",
      "opposed them, or prayed in the _Martyries_ of the hereticks. They also\n",
      "lighted torches to the Martyrs in the day-time, as the heathens did to\n",
      "their Gods; which custom, before the end of the fourth century, prevailed\n",
      "much in the _West_. They sprinkled the worshipers of the Martyrs with\n",
      "holy-water, as the heathens did the worshipers of their Gods; and went in\n",
      "pilgrimage to see _Jerusalem_ and other holy places, as if those places\n",
      "conferred sanctity on the visiters. From the custom of praying in the\n",
      "_Coemeteries_ and _Martyries_, came the custom of translating the bodies of\n",
      "the Saints and Martyrs into such Churches as were new built: the Emperor\n",
      "_Constantius_ began this practice about the year 359, causing the bodies of\n",
      "_Andrew_ the Apostle, _Luke_ and _Timothy_, to be translated into a new\n",
      "Church at _Constantinople_: and before this act of _Constantius_, the\n",
      "_Egyptians_ kept the bodies of their Martyrs and Saints unburied upon beds\n",
      "in their private houses, and told stories of their souls appearing after\n",
      "death and ascending up to heaven, as _Athanasius_ relates in the life of\n",
      "_Antony_. All which gave occasion to the Emperor _Julian_, as _Cyril_\n",
      "relates, to accuse the _Christians_ in this manner: _Your adding to that\n",
      "antient dead man, Jesus, many new dead men, who can sufficiently abominate?\n",
      "You have filled all places with sepulchres and monuments, altho you are no\n",
      "where bidden to prostrate yourselves to sepulchres, and to respect them\n",
      "officiously._ And a little after: _Since _Jesus_ said that sepulchres are\n",
      "full of filthiness, how do you invoke God upon them_? and in another place\n",
      "he saith, that if _Christians_ had adhered to the precepts of the\n",
      "_Hebrews_, _they would have worshiped one God instead of many, and not a\n",

      "Martyrs buried in them, and annual festivals were kept to them, with\n",
      "sacrifices offered to God in their name; the next step towards the\n",
      "invocation of Saints, was the attributing to their dead bodies, bones and\n",
      "other reliques, a power of working miracles, by means of the separate\n",
      "souls, who were supposed to know what we do or say, and to be able to do us\n",
      "good or hurt, and to work those miracles. This was the very notion the\n",

      "they worshiped under the names of _Saturn_, _Rhea_, _Jupiter_, _Juno_,\n",
      "_Mars_, _Venus_, _Bacchus_, _Ceres_, _Osiris_, _Isis_, _Apollo_, _Diana_,\n",

      "Saints was set on foot by the persecution of _Decius_, and the second by\n",
      "the persecution of _Dioclesian_; so this third seems to have been owing to\n",
      "the proceedings of _Constantius_ and _Julian_ the Apostate. When _Julian_\n",
      "began to restore the worship of the heathen Gods, and to vilify the Saints\n",

      "_Antioch_ followed the example of _Egypt_, in dispersing the reliques of\n",

      "followed by the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reliques of the forty Martyrs at _Antioch_ were distributed among the\n",

      "forty Martyrs. Now since the Monks of _Alexandria_ sent the reliques of the\n",
      "Martyrs of _Egypt_ into all parts of the earth, and thereby acquired glory\n",
      "to their city, and declared her in these matters the Metropolis of the\n",
      "whole world, as we have observed out of _Chrysostom_; it may be concluded,\n",
      "that before _Alexandria_ received the forty Martyrs from _Antioch_, she\n",
      "began to send out the reliques of her own Martyrs into all parts, setting\n",
      "the first example to other cities. This practice therefore began in _Egypt_\n",
      "some years before the death of _Athanasius_. It began when the\n",
      "miracle-working bones of _John_ the Baptist were carried into _Egypt_, and\n",
      "hid in the wall of a Church, _that they might be profitable to future\n",
      "generations_. It was restrained in the reign of _Julian_ the Apostate: and\n",
      "then it spred from _Egypt_ into all the Empire, _Alexandria_ being the\n",
      "Metropolis of the whole world, according to _Chrysostom_, for propagating\n",

      "example.\n",

      "_Athanasius_ relates that these were his dying words to his disciples who\n",
      "then attended him. _Do you take care_, said _Antony_, _to adhere to\n",
      "_Christ_ in the first place, and then to the Saints, that after death they\n",
      "may receive you as friends and acquaintance into the everlasting\n",
      "tabernacles, Think upon these things, perceive these things; and if you\n",
      "have any regard to me, remember me as a father_. This being delivered in\n",
      "charge to the Monks by _Antony_ at his death, A.C. 356, could not but\n",
      "inflame their whole body with devotion towards the Saints, as the ready way\n",
      "to be received, by them into the eternal Tabernacles after death. Hence\n",
      "came that noise about the miracles, done by the reliques of the Saints in\n",
      "the time of _Constantius_: hence came the dispersion of the miracle-working\n",
      "reliques into all the Empire; _Alexandria_ setting the example, and being\n",
      "renowned, for it above all other cities. Hence it came to pass in the days\n",
      "of _Julian_, A.C. 362, that _Athanasius_ by a prophetic spirit, as\n",
      "_Ruffinus_ tells us, hid the bones of _John_ the Baptist from the Heathens,\n",
      "not in the ground to be forgotten, but in the hollow wall of a Church\n",
      "before proper witnesses, that they might _be profitable to future\n",
      "generations_. Hence also came the invocation of the Saints for doing such\n",
      "miracles, and for assisting men in their devotions, and mediating with God.\n",
      "For _Athanasius_, even from his youth, looked upon the dead Saints and\n",
      "Martyrs as mediators of our prayers: in his Epistle to _Marcellinus_,\n",
      "written in the days of _Constantine_ the great, he saith that the words of\n",
      "the _Psalms_ are not to be transposed or any wise changed, but to be\n",
      "recited and sung without any artifice, as they are written, _that the holy\n",
      "men who delivered them, knowing them to be their own words, may pray with\n",
      "us; or rather, that the Holy Ghost who spake in the holy men, seeing his\n",

      "\n",
      "_IrenÃ¦us_ introduced an opinion that the _Apocalypse_ was written in the\n",
      "time of _Domitian_; but then he also postponed the writing of some others\n",
      "of the sacred books, and was to place the _Apocalypse_ after them: he might\n",
      "perhaps have heard from his master _Polycarp_ that he had received this\n",
      "book from _John_ about the time of _Domitian_'s death; or indeed _John_\n",
      "might himself at that time have made a new publication of it, from whence\n",
      "_IrenÃ¦us_ might imagine it was then but newly written. _Eusebius_ in his\n",
      "_Chronicle_ and _Ecclesiastical History_ follows _Irenoeus_; but afterwards\n",
      "[1] in his _Evangelical Demonstrations_, he conjoins the banishment of\n",
      "_John_ into _Patmos_, with the deaths of _Peter_ and _Paul_: and so do [2]\n",
      "_Tertullian_ and _Pseudo-Prochorus_, as well as the first author, whoever\n",
      "he was, of that very antient fable, that _John_ was put by _Nero_ into a\n",
      "vessel of hot oil, and coming out unhurt, was banished by him into\n",
      "_Patmos._ Tho this story be no more than a fiction yet was it founded on a\n",
      "tradition of the first churches, that _John_ was banished into _Patmos_ in\n",
      "the days of _Nero_. _Epiphanius_ represents the _Gospel of John_ as written\n",
      "in the time of _Domitian_, and the _Apocalypse_ even before that of _Nero_.\n",
      "[3] _Arethas_ in the beginning of his Commentary quotes the opinion of\n",
      "_IrenÃ¦us_ from _Eusebius_, but follows it not: for he afterwards affirms\n",
      "the _Apocalypse_ was written before the destruction of _Jerusalem_, and\n",
      "that former commentators had expounded the sixth seal of that destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the opinion of the first Commentators agrees the tradition of the\n",
      "Churches of _Syria_, preserved to this day in the title of the _Syriac_\n",
      "Version of the _Apocalypse_, which title is this: _The Revelation which was\n",
      "made to _John_ the Evangelist by God in the Island _Patmos_, into which he\n",
      "was banished by _Nero_ the _CÃ¦sar__. The fame is confirmed by a story told\n",
      "by [4] _Eusebius_ out of _Clemens Alexandrinus_, and other antient authors,\n",
      "concerning a youth, whom _John_ some time after his return from _Patmos_\n",
      "committed to the care of the Bishop of a certain city. The Bishop educated,\n",
      "instructed, and at length baptized him; but then remitting of his care, the\n",
      "young man thereupon got into ill company, and began by degrees first to\n",
      "revel and grow vitious, then to abuse and spoil those he met in the night;\n",
      "and at last grew so desperate, that his companions turning a band of\n",
      "high-way men, made him their Captain: and, saith [5] _Chrysostom_, he\n",
      "continued their Captain a long time. At length _John_ returning to that\n",
      "city, and hearing what was done, rode to the thief; and, when he out of\n",
      "reverence to his old master fled, _John_ rode after him, recalled him, and\n",
      "restored him to the Church. This is a story of many years, and requires\n",
      "that _John_ should have returned from _Patmos_ rather at the death of\n",
      "_Nero_ than at that of _Domitian_; because between the death of _Domitian_\n",
      "and that of _John_ there were but two years and an half; and _John_ in his\n",
      "old age was [6] so infirm as to be carried to Church, dying above 90 years\n",
      "old, and therefore could not be then suppos'd able to ride after the thief.\n",
      "\n",
      "This opinion is further supported by the allusions in the _Apocalypse_ to\n",
      "the Temple and Altar, and holy City, as then standing; and to the\n",
      "_Gentiles_, who were soon after to tread under foot the holy City and\n",
      "outward Court. 'Tis confirmed also by the style of the _Apocalypse_ itself,\n",
      "which is fuller of _Hebraisms_ than his Gospel. For thence it may be\n",
      "gathered, that it was written when _John_ was newly come out of _Judea_,\n",
      "where he had been used to the _Syriac_ tongue; and that he did not write\n",
      "his Gospel, till by long converse with the _Asiatick_ Greeks he had left\n",
      "off most of the _Hebraisms_. It is confirmed also by the many false\n",
      "_Apocalypses_, as those of _Peter_, _Paul_, _Thomas_, _Stephen_, _Elias_\n",
      "and _Cerinthus_, written in imitation of the true one. For as the many\n",
      "false Gospels, false Acts, and false Epistles were occasioned by true ones;\n",
      "and the writing many false _Apocalypses_, and ascribing them to Apostles\n",
      "and Prophets, argues that there was a true Apostolic one in great request\n",
      "with the first _Christians_: so this true one may well be suppos'd to have\n",
      "been written early, that there may be room in the Apostolic age for the\n",
      "writing of so many false ones afterwards, and fathering them upon _Peter_,\n",
      "_Paul_, _Thomas_ and others, who were dead before _John_. _Caius_, who was\n",
      "contemporary with _Tertullian_, [7] tells us that _Cerinthus_ wrote his\n",
      "Revelations as a great Apostle, and pretended the visions were shewn him by\n",
      "Angels, asserting a _millennium_ of carnal pleasures at _Jerusalem_ after\n",
      "the resurrection; so that his _Apocalypse_ was plainly written in imitation\n",
      "of _John_'s: and yet he lived so early, that [8] he resisted the Apostles\n",
      "at _Jerusalem_ in or before the first year of _Claudius_, that is, 26 years\n",
      "before the death of _Nero_, and [9] died before _John_.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reasons may suffice for determining the time; and yet there is one\n",
      "more, which to considering men may seem a good reason, to others not. I'll\n",
      "propound it, and leave it to every man's judgment. The _Apocalypse_ seems\n",
      "to be alluded to in the Epistles of _Peter_ and that to the _Hebrews_ and\n",
      "therefore to have been written before them. Such allusions in the Epistle\n",
      "to the _Hebrews_, I take to be the discourses concerning the High-Priest in\n",
      "the heavenly Tabernacle, who is both Priest and King, as was _Melchisedec_;\n",
      "and those concerning the _word of God_, with the _sharp two-edged sword_,\n",
      "the [Greek: sabbatismos], or _millennial_ rest, the _earth whose end is to\n",
      "be burned_, suppose by the lake of fire, _the judgment and fiery\n",
      "indignation which shall devour the adversaries_, the _heavenly City which\n",
      "hath foundations whose builder and maker is God_, the _cloud of witnesses,\n",
      "mount _Sion_, heavenly _Jerusalem_, general assembly, spirits of just men\n",
      "made perfect_, viz. by the resurrection, and _the shaking of heaven and\n",
      "earth, and removing them, that the new heaven, new earth and new kingdom\n",
      "which cannot be shaken, may remain_. In the first of _Peter_ occur these:\n",
      "[10] _The Revelation of Jesus Christ_, twice or thrice repeated; [11] the\n",
      "_blood of _Christ_ as of a Lamb foreordained before the foundation of the\n",
      "world_; [12] the _spiritual building_ in heaven, 1 Pet. ii. 5. _an\n",
      "inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away, reserved\n",
      "in heaven for us, who are kept unto the salvation, ready to be revealed in\n",

      "_the Church at _Babylon__. These are indeed obscurer allusions; but the\n",
      "second Epistle, from the 19th verse of the first Chapter to the end, seems\n",

      "understand it: for _no Prophecy_, saith he, _of the scripture is of any\n",

      "man, but holy men of God spake, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\n",
      "Daniel_ [17] himself professes that he understood not his own _Prophecies_;\n",
      "and therefore the Churches were not to expect the interpretation from their\n",
      "Prophet _John_, but to study the Prophecies themselves. This is the\n",
      "substance of what _Peter_ says in the first chapter; and then in the second\n",
      "he proceeds to describe, out of this _sure word of Prophecy_, how there\n",

      "Seeing therefore _Peter_ and _John_ were Apostles of the circumcision, it\n",
      "seems to me that they staid with their Churches in _Judea_ and _Syria_ till\n",
      "the _Romans_ made war upon their nation, that is, till the twelfth year of\n",
      "_Nero_; that they then followed the main body of their flying Churches into\n",
      "_Asia_, and that _Peter_ went thence by _Corinth_ to _Rome_; that the\n",
      "_Roman_ Empire looked upon those Churches as enemies, because _Jews_ by\n",
      "birth; and therefore to prevent insurrections, secured their leaders, and\n",
      "banished _John_ into _Patmos_. It seems also probable to me that the\n",
      "_Apocalypse_ was there composed, and that soon after the Epistle to the\n",
      "_Hebrews_ and those of _Peter_ were written to these Churches, with\n",
      "reference to this Prophecy as what they were particularly concerned in. For\n",
      "it appears by these Epistles, that they were written in times of general\n",
      "affliction and tribulation under the heathens, and by consequence when the\n",
      "Empire made war upon the _Jews_; for till then the heathens were at peace\n",

      "\n",
      "This account of things agrees best with history when duly rectified. For\n",
      "[29] _Justin_ and [30] _IrenÃ¦us_ say, that _Simon Magus_ came to _Rome_ in\n",
      "the reign of _Claudius_, and exercised juggling tricks there.\n",
      "_Pseudo-Clemens_ adds, that he endeavoured there to fly, but broke his neck\n",
      "thro' the prayers of _Peter_. Whence [31] _Eusebius_, or rather his\n",
      "interpolator _Jerom_, has recorded, that _Peter_ came to _Rome_ in the\n",
      "second year of _Claudius_: but [32] _Cyril_ Bishop of _Jerusalem_,\n",
      "_Philastrius_, _Sulpitius_, _Prosper_, _Maximus Taurinensis_, and\n",
      "_Hegesippus junior_, place this victory of _Peter_ in the time of _Nero_.\n",
      "Indeed the antienter tradition was, that _Peter_ came to _Rome_ in the days\n",
      "of this Emperor, as may be seen in [33] _Lactantius_. _Chrysostom_ [34]\n",
      "tells us, that the Apostles continued long in _Judea_, and that then being\n",
      "driven out by the _Jews_ they went to the _Gentiles_. This dispersion was\n",
      "in the first year of the _Jewish_ war, when the _Jews_, as _Josephus_ tells\n",
      "us, began to be tumultuous and violent in all places. For all agree that\n",
      "the Apostles were dispersed into several regions at once; and _Origen_ has\n",
      "set down the time, [35] telling us that in the beginning of the _Judaic_\n",
      "war, the Apostles and disciples of our Lord were scattered into all\n",
      "nations; _Thomas_ into _Parthia_, _Andrew_ into _Scythia_, _John_ into\n",
      "_Asia_, and _Peter_ first into _Asia_, where he preacht to the dispersion,\n",
      "and thence into _Italy_. [36] _Dionysius Corinthius_ saith, that _Peter_\n",
      "went from _Asia_ by _Corinth_ to _Rome_, and all antiquity agrees that\n",
      "_Peter_ and _Paul_ were martyred there in the end of _Nero_'s reign. _Mark_\n",
      "went with _Timothy_ to _Rome_, 2 _Tim._ iv. 11. _Colos._ iv. 10. _Sylvanus_\n",
      "was _Paul_'s assistant; and by the companions of _Peter_, mentioned in his\n",

      "2 _Pet._ iii. 1. and therein he saith, that _Paul_ had writ of the same\n",
      "things to them, and also in his other Epistles, _ver._ 15, 16. Now as there\n",
      "is no Epistle of _Paul_ to these strangers besides that to the _Hebrews_,\n",
      "so in this Epistle, chap. x. 11, 12. we find at large all those things\n",
      "which _Peter_ had been speaking of, and here refers to; particularly the\n",
      "_passing away of the old heavens and earth_, and _establishing an\n",
      "inheritance immoveable_, with an exhortation to grace, because _God_, to\n",
      "the wicked, _is a consuming fire_, Heb. xii. 25, 26, 28, 29.\n",

      "Having determined the time of writing the _Apocalyse_, I need not say much\n",
      "about the truth of it, since it was in such request with the first ages,\n",
      "that many endeavoured to imitate it, by feigning _Apocalypses_ under the\n",
      "Apostles names; and the Apostles themselves, as I have just now shewed,\n",
      "studied it, and used its phrases; by which means the style of the Epistle\n",
      "to the _Hebrews_ became more mystical than that of _Paul_'s other Epistles,\n",
      "and the style of _John_'s Gospel more figurative and majestical than that\n",
      "of the other Gospels. I do not apprehend that _Christ_ was called the word\n",
      "of God in any book of the New Testament written before the _Apocalypse_;\n",
      "and therefore am of opinion, the language was taken from this Prophecy, as\n",
      "were also many other phrases in this Gospel, such as those of _Christ_'s\n",
      "being _the light which enlightens the world, the lamb of God which taketh\n",
      "away the sins of the world, the bridegroom, he that testifieth, he that\n",
      "came down from heaven, the Son of God_, &c. _Justin Martyr_, who within\n",
      "thirty years after _John_'s death became a _Christian_, writes expresly\n",
      "that _a certain man among the _Christians_ whose name was _John_, one of\n",
      "the twelve Apostles of _Christ_, in the Revelation which was shewed him,\n",
      "prophesied that those who believed in _Christ_ should live a thousand years\n",
      "at _Jerusalem__. And a few lines before he saith: _But I, and as many as\n",
      "are _Christians_, in all things right in their opinions, believe both that\n",
      "there shall be a resurrection of the flesh, and a thousand years life at\n",
      "_Jerusalem_ built, adorned and enlarged_. Which is as much as to say, that\n",
      "all true _Christians_ in that early age received this Prophecy: for in all\n",
      "ages, as many as believed the thousand years, received the _Apocalypse_ as\n",
      "the foundation of their opinion: and I do not know one instance to the\n",
      "contrary. _Papias_ Bishop of _Hierapolis_, a man of the Apostolic age, and\n",
      "one of _John_'s own disciples, did not only teach the doctrine of the\n",
      "thousand years, but also [37] asserted the _Apocalypse_ as written by\n",
      "divine inspiration. _Melito_, who flourished next after _Justin_, [38]\n",
      "wrote a commentary upon this Prophecy; and he, being Bishop of _Sardis_ one\n",
      "of the seven Churches, could neither be ignorant of their tradition about\n",
      "it, nor impose upon them. _IrenÃ¦us_, who was contemporary with _Melito_,\n",
      "wrote much upon it, and said, that _the number 666 was in all the antient\n",
      "and approved copies; and that he had it also confirmed to him by those who\n",
      "had seen _John_ face to face_, meaning no doubt his master _Polycarp_ for\n",
      "one. At the same time [39] _Theophilus_ Bishop of _Antioch_ asserted it,\n",
      "and so did _Tertullian_, _Clemens Alexandrinus_, and _Origen_ soon after;\n",
      "and their contemporary _Hippolytus_ the Martyr, Metropolitan of the\n",
      "_Arabians_, [40] wrote a commentary upon it. All these were antient men,\n",
      "flourishing within a hundred and twenty years after _John_'s death, and of\n",
      "greatest note in the Churches of those times. Soon after did _Victorinus\n",
      "Pictaviensis_ write another commentary upon it; and he lived in the time of\n",
      "_Dioclesian_. This may surely suffice to shew how the _Apocalypse_ was\n",
      "received and studied in the first ages: and I do not indeed find any other\n",
      "book of the New Testament so strongly attested, or commented upon so early\n",
      "as this. The Prophecy said: _Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear\n",
      "the words of this Prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein._\n",
      "This animated the first _Christians_ to study it so much, till the\n",
      "difficulty made them remit, and comment more upon the other books of the\n",
      "New Testament. This was the state of the _Apocalypse_, till the thousand\n",
      "years being misunderstood, brought a prejudice against it: and _Dionysius_\n",
      "of _Alexandria_, noting how it abounded with barbarisms, that is with\n",
      "_Hebraisms_, promoted that prejudice so far, as to cause many _Greeks_ in\n",
      "the fourth century to doubt of the book. But whilst the _Latins_, and a\n",
      "great part of the _Greeks_, always retained the _Apocalypse_, and the rest\n",
      "doubted only out of prejudice, it makes nothing against its authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Prophecy is called _the Revelation_, with respect to _the scripture of\n",
      "truth_, which _Daniel_ [41] was commanded to _shut up and seal, till the\n",
      "time of the end_. _Daniel_ sealed it _until the time of the end_; and until\n",
      "that time comes, the Lamb is opening the seals: and afterwards the two\n",
      "Witnesses prophesy out of it a long time in sack-cloth, before they ascend\n",
      "up to heaven in a cloud. All which is as much as to say, that these\n",
      "Prophecies of _Daniel_ and _John_ should not be understood till the time of\n",
      "the end: but then some should prophesy out of them in an afflicted and\n",
      "mournful state for a long time, and that but darkly, so as to convert but\n",
      "few. But in the very end, the Prophecy should be so far interpreted as to\n",
      "convince many. _Then_, saith _Daniel, many shall run to and fro, and\n",
      "knowledge shall be encreased_. For the Gospel must be preached in all\n",
      "nations before the great tribulation, and end of the world. The\n",
      "palm-bearing multitude, which come out of this great tribulation, cannot be\n",
      "innumerable out of all nations, unless they be made so by the preaching of\n",
      "the Gospel before it comes. There must be a stone cut out of a mountain\n",
      "without hands, before it can fall upon the toes of the Image, and become a\n",
      "great mountain and fill the earth. An Angel must fly thro' the midst of\n",
      "heaven with the everlasting Gospel to preach to all nations, before\n",
      "_Babylon_ falls, and the Son of man reaps his harvest. The two Prophets\n",
      "must ascend up to heaven in a cloud, before the kingdoms of this world\n",
      "become the kingdoms of _Christ_. 'Tis therefore a part of this Prophecy,\n",
      "that it should not be understood before the last age of the world; and\n",
      "therefore it makes for the credit of the Prophecy, that it is not yet\n",
      "understood. But if the last age, the age of opening these things, be now\n",
      "approaching, as by the great successes of late Interpreters it seems to be,\n",
      "we have more encouragement than ever to look into these things. If the\n",
      "general preaching of the Gospel be approaching, it is to us and our\n",
      "posterity that those words mainly belong: [42] _In the time of the end the\n",
      "wise shall understand, but none of the wicked shall understand. [43]\n",
      "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophecy,\n",
      "and keep those things which are written therein._\n",

      "The folly of Interpreters has been, to foretel times and things by this\n",
      "Prophecy, as if God designed to make them Prophets. By this rashness they\n",
      "have not only exposed themselves, but brought the Prophecy also into\n",
      "contempt. The design of God was much otherwise. He gave this and the\n",
      "Prophecies of the Old Testament, not to gratify men's curiosities by\n",
      "enabling them to foreknow things, but that after they were fulfilled they\n",
      "might be interpreted by the event, and his own Providence, not the\n",
      "Interpreters, be then manifested thereby to the world. For the event of\n",
      "things predicted many ages before, will then be a convincing argument that\n",
      "the world is governed by providence. For as the few and obscure Prophecies\n",
      "concerning _Christ_'s first coming were for setting up the _Christian_\n",
      "religion, which all nations have since corrupted; so the many and clear\n",
      "Prophecies concerning the things to be done at _Christ_'s second coming,\n",
      "are not only for predicting but also for effecting a recovery and\n",
      "re-establishment of the long-lost truth, and setting up a kingdom wherein\n",
      "dwells righteousness. The event will prove the _Apocalypse_; and this\n",
      "Prophecy, thus proved and understood, will open the old Prophets, and all\n",
      "together will make known the true religion, and establish it. For he that\n",
      "will understand the old Prophets, must begin with this; but the time is not\n",
      "yet come for understanding them perfectly, because the main revolution\n",
      "predicted in them is not yet come to pass. _In the days of the voice of the\n",
      "seventh Angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be\n",
      "finished, as he hath declared to his servants the Prophets_: and then _the\n",

      "_Christ_, and he shall reign for ever_, Apoc. x. 7. xi. 15. There is\n",
      "already so much of the Prophecy fulfilled, that as many as will take pains\n",
      "in this study, may see sufficient instances of God's providence: but then\n",
      "the signal revolutions predicted by all the holy Prophets, will at once\n",
      "both turn mens eyes upon considering the predictions, and plainly interpret\n",

      "creator seal you to a good year_. For they conceive that the books are now\n",
      "sealed up, and that the sentence of God remains unchanged henceforward to\n",
      "the end of the year. The same thing is signified by the two Goats, upon\n",

      "as when a lion roareth_. It was the custom for the High-Priest on the day\n",
      "of expiation, to stand in an elevated place in the peoples court, at the\n",
      "Eastern gate of the Priests court, and read the Law to the people, while\n",
      "the Heifer and the Goat which was the Lord's lot, were burning without the\n",
      "Temple. We may therefore suppose him standing in such a manner, that his\n",
      "right foot might appear to _John_ as it were standing on the sea of glass,\n",
      "and his left foot on the ground of the house; and that he cried with a loud\n",
      "voice, in reading the Law on the day of expiation. _And when he had cried,\n",
      "seven thunders uttered their voices_. Thunders are the voice of a cloud,\n",
      "and a cloud signifies a multitude; and this multitude may be the _Levites_,\n",
      "who sang with thundering voices, and played with musical instruments at the\n",
      "great sacrifices, on the seven days of the feast of Tabernacles: at which\n",
      "times the trumpets also sounded. For the trumpets sounded, and the\n",
      "_Levites_ sang alternately, three times at every sacrifice. The Prophecy\n",
      "therefore of the seven thunders is nothing else than a repetition of the\n",
      "Prophecy of the seven trumpets in another form. _And the Angel which I saw\n",
      "stand upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and\n",
      "sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, that_ after the seven thunders\n",
      "_there should be time no longer; but in the days of the voice of the\n",
      "seventh Angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be\n",
      "finished, as he hath declared to his servants the Prophets_. The voices of\n",
      "the thunders therefore last to the end of this world, and so do those of\n",
      "the trumpets.\n",
      "\n",
      "_And the voice which I heard from heaven_, saith _John_, _spake unto me\n",
      "again and said, Go and take the little book, &c. And I took the little book\n",
      "out of the Angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as\n",
      "honey, and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto\n",
      "me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues,\n",
      "and kings_. This is an introduction to a new Prophecy, to a repetition of\n",
      "the Prophecy of the whole book; and alludes to _Ezekiel_'s eating a roll or\n",
      "book spread open before him, and written within and without, full of\n",
      "lamentations and mourning and woe, but sweet in his mouth. Eating and\n",
      "drinking signify acquiring and possessing; and eating the book is becoming\n",
      "inspired with the Prophecy contained in it. It implies being inspired in a\n",
      "vigorous and extraordinary manner with the Prophecy of the whole book, and\n",
      "therefore signifies a lively repetition of the whole Prophecy by way of\n",
      "interpretation, and begins not till the first Prophecy, that of the seals\n",
      "and trumpets, is ended. It was sweet in _John_'s mouth, and therefore\n",
      "begins not with the bitter Prophecy of the _Babylonian_ captivity, and the\n",
      "_Gentiles_ being in the outward court of the Temple, and treading the holy\n",
      "city under foot; and the prophesying of the _two Witnesses_ in sackcloth,\n",
      "and their smiting the earth with all plagues, and being killed by the\n",
      "Beast; but so soon as the Prophecy of the trumpets is ended, it begins with\n",
      "the sweet Prophecy of the glorious _Woman in heaven_, and the victory of\n",
      "_Michael_ over the Dragon; and after that, it is bitter in _John_'s belly,\n",
      "by a large description of the times of the great Apostacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "_And the Angel stood_, upon the earth and sea, _saying, Rise and measure\n",
      "the Temple of God and the Altar, and them that worship therein_, that is,\n",
      "their courts with the buildings thereon, viz. the square court of the\n",
      "Temple called the separate place, and the square court of the Altar called\n",
      "the Priests court, and the court of them that worship in the Temple called\n",

      "reference to _Ezekiel_'s measuring the Temple _of Solomon_: there the whole\n",
      "Temple, including the outward court, was measured, to signify that it\n",
      "should be rebuilt in the latter days. Here the courts of the Temple and\n",
      "Altar, and they who worship therein, are only measured, to signify the\n",
      "building of a second Temple, for those that are sealed out of all the\n",
      "twelve tribes of _Israel_, and worship in the inward court of sincerity and\n",
      "truth: but _John_ is commanded to leave out the outward court, or outward\n",
      "form of religion and Church-government, because it is given to the\n",
      "_Babylonian Gentiles_. For the glorious woman in heaven, the remnant of\n",
      "whole seed kept the commandments of God, and had the testimony of _Jesus_,\n",
      "continued the same woman in outward form after her flight into the\n",
      "wilderness, whereby she quitted her former sincerity and piety, and became\n",
      "the great Whore. She lost her chastity, but kept her outward form and\n",
      "shape. And while the _Gentiles_ tread the holy city underfoot, and worship\n",
      "in the outward court, the two witnesses, represented perhaps by the two\n",
      "feet of the Angel standing on the sea and earth, prophesied against them,\n",
      "and _had power_, like _Elijah_ and _Moses_, _to consume their enemies with\n",
      "fire proceeding out of their mouth, and to shut heaven that it rain not in\n",
      "the days of their Prophecy, and to turn the waters into blood, and to smite\n",
      "the earth with all plagues as often as they will_, that is, with the\n",
      "plagues of the trumpets and vials of wrath; and at length they are slain,\n",
      "rise again from the dead, and ascend up to heaven in a cloud; and then the\n",

      "The Prophecy being finished, _John_ is inspired anew by the eaten book, and\n",
      "begins the Interpretation thereof with these words, _And the Temple of God\n",
      "was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his Temple the Ark of the\n",
      "Testament_. By the Ark, we may know that this was the first Temple; for the\n",
      "second Temple had no Ark. _And there were lightnings, and voices, and\n",
      "thundrings, and an earthquake, and great hail_. These answer to the wars in\n",
      "the _Roman_ Empire, during the reign of the four horsemen, who appeared\n",
      "upon opening the first four seals. _And there appeared a great wonder in\n",
      "heaven, a woman clothed with the Sun_. In the Prophecy, the affairs of the\n",
      "Church begin to be considered at the opening of the fifth seal; and in the\n",
      "Interpretation, they begin at the same time with the vision of the Church\n",
      "in the form of a woman in heaven: there she is persecuted, and here she is\n",
      "pained in travail. The Interpretation proceeds down first to the sealing of\n",
      "the servants of God, and marking the rest with the mark of the Beast; and\n",
      "then to the day of judgment, represented by a harvest and vintage. Then it\n",
      "returns back to the times of opening the seventh seal, and interprets the\n",
      "Prophecy of the seven trumpets by the pouring out of seven vials of wrath.\n",
      "The Angels who pour them out, come out of the _Temple of the Tabernacle_;\n",
      "that is, out of the second Temple, for the Tabernacle had no outward court.\n",

      "_Of the relation which the Prophecy of _John_ hath to those of _Daniel_;\n",
      "and of the Subject of the Prophecy_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole scene of sacred Prophecy is composed of three principal parts:\n",
      "the regions beyond _Euphrates_, represented by the two first Beasts of\n",
      "_Daniel_; the Empire of the _Greeks_ on this side of _Euphrates_,\n",
      "represented by the Leopard and by the He-Goat; and the Empire of the\n",
      "_Latins_ on this side of _Greece_, represented by the Beast with ten horns.\n",
      "And to these three parts, the phrases of the _third part of the earth, sea,\n",
      "rivers, trees, ships, stars, sun, and moon_, relate. I place the body of\n",
      "the fourth Beast on this side of _Greece_, because the three first of the\n",
      "four Beasts had their lives prolonged after their dominion was taken away,\n",
      "and therefore belong not to the body of the fourth. He only stamped them\n",
      "with his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the _earth_, the _Jews_ understood the great continent of all _Asia_ and\n",
      "_Africa_, to which they had access by land: and by the Isles of the _sea_,\n",
      "they understood the places to which they sailed by sea, particularly all\n",
      "_Europe_: and hence in this Prophecy, the _earth_ and _sea_ are put for the\n",
      "nations of the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third and fourth Beasts of _Daniel_ are the same with the Dragon and\n",
      "ten-horned Beast of _John_, but with this difference: _John_ puts the\n",
      "Dragon for the whole _Roman_ Empire while it continued entire, because it\n",
      "was entire when that Prophecy was given; and the Beast he considers not\n",
      "till the Empire became divided: and then he puts the Dragon for the Empire\n",
      "of the _Greeks_, and the Beast for the Empire of the _Latins_. Hence it is\n",
      "that the Dragon and Beast have common heads and common horns: but the\n",
      "Dragon hath crowns only upon his heads, and the Beast only upon his horns;\n",
      "because the Beast and his horns reigned not before they were divided from\n",
      "the Dragon: and when the Dragon gave the Beast his throne, the ten horns\n",
      "received power as Kings, the same hour with the Beast. The heads are seven\n",
      "successive Kings. Four of them were the four horsemen which appeared at the\n",
      "opening of the first four seals. In the latter end of the sixth head, or\n",
      "seal, considered as present in the visions, it is said, _five_ of the seven\n",
      "Kings _are fallen, and one is, and another is not yet come; and the Beast\n",
      "that was and is not_, being wounded to death with a sword, _he is the\n",
      "eighth, and of the seven_: he was therefore a collateral part of the\n",
      "seventh. The horns are the same with those of _Daniel_'s fourth Beast,\n",
      "described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "The four horsemen which appear at the opening of the first four seals, have\n",
      "been well explained by Mr. _Mede_; excepting that I had rather continue the\n",
      "third to the end of the reign of the three _Gordians_ and _Philip_ the\n",
      "_Arabian_, those being Kings from the _South_, and begin the fourth with\n",
      "the reign of _Decius_, and continue it till the reign of _Dioclesian_. For\n",
      "the fourth horseman _sat upon a pale_ horse, _and his name was Death; and\n",
      "hell followed with him; and power was given them to kill unto the fourth\n",
      "part of the earth, with the sword, and with famine, and with the plague,\n",
      "and with the Beasts of the earth_, or armies of invaders and rebels: and as\n",
      "such were the times during all this interval. Hitherto the _Roman_ Empire\n",
      "continued in an undivided monarchical form, except rebellions; and such it\n",
      "is represented by the four horsemen. But _Dioclesian_ divided it between\n",
      "himself and _Maximianus_, A.C. 285; and it continued in that divided state,\n",
      "till the victory of _Constantine_ the great over _Licinius_, A.C. 323,\n",
      "which put an end to the heathen persecutions set on foot by _Dioclesian_\n",
      "and _Maximianus_, and described at the opening of the fifth seal. But this\n",
      "division of the Empire was imperfect, the whole being still under one and\n",
      "the same Senate. The same victory of _Constantine_ over _Licinius_ a\n",
      "heathen persecutor, began the fall of the heathen Empire, described at the\n",
      "opening of the sixth seal: and the visions of this seal continue till after\n",
      "the reign of _Julian_ the Apostate, he being a heathen Emperor, and\n",
      "reigning over the whole _Roman_ Empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The affairs of the Church begin to be considered at the opening of the\n",
      "fifth seal, as was said above. Then she is represented by _a woman_ in the\n",
      "Temple of heaven, _clothed with the sun_ of righteousness, _and the moon_\n",
      "of _Jewish_ ceremonies _under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve\n",
      "stars_ relating to the twelve Apostles and to the twelve tribes of\n",
      "_Israel_. When she fled from the Temple into the wilderness, she left in\n",
      "the Temple a _remnant of her seed, who kept the commandments of God, and\n",
      "had the testimony of Jesus Christ_; and therefore before her flight she\n",
      "represented the true primitive Church of God, tho afterwards she\n",
      "degenerated like _Aholah_ and _Aholibah_. In _Diocesian_'s persecution _she\n",
      "cried, travelling in birth, and pained to be delivered_. And in the end of\n",
      "that persecution, by the victory of _Constantine_ over _Maxentius_ A.C.\n",
      "312, _she brought forth a man-child_, such a child as _was to rule all\n",
      "nations with a rod of iron_, a _Christian_ Empire. _And her child_, by the\n",
      "victory of _Constantine_ over _Licinius_, A.C. 323, _was caught up unto God\n",
      "and to his throne. And the woman_, by the division of the _Roman_ Empire\n",
      "into the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires, _fled_ from the first Temple _into\n",
      "the wilderness_, or spiritually barren Empire of the _Latins_, where she is\n",
      "found afterwards sitting upon the Beast and upon the seven mountains; and\n",
      "is called _the great city which reigneth over the Kings of the earth_, that\n",
      "is, over the ten Kings who give their kingdom to her Beast.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before her flight there was war in heaven between _Michael_ and the\n",
      "Dragon, the _Christian_ and the heathen religions; and the Dragon, _that\n",
      "old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, who deceiveth the whole world, was\n",
      "cast out to the earth, and his Angels were cast out with him_. And _John\n",
      "heard a voice in heaven, saying, Now is come salvation and strength, and\n",
      "the kingdom of our God, and the power of his _Christ_: for the accuser of\n",
      "our brethren is cast down. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,\n",
      "and by the word of their testimony. And they loved not their lives unto the\n",
      "death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe be to\n",
      "the inhabiters of the earth and sea_, or people of the _Greek_ and _Latin_\n",
      "Empires, _for the devil is come down amongst you, having great wrath,\n",
      "because he knoweth that he hath but a short time_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_And when the Dragon saw that he was cast down_ from the _Roman_ throne,\n",
      "and the man-child caught up thither, he _persecuted the woman which brought\n",
      "forth the man-child; and to her_, by the division of the _Roman_ Empire\n",
      "between the cities of _Rome_ and _Constantinople_ A.C. 330, _were given two\n",
      "wings of a great eagle_, the symbol of the _Roman_ Empire, _that she might\n",
      "flee_ from the first Temple _into the wilderness_ of _Arabia, to her place_\n",
      "at _Babylon_ mystically so called. _And the serpent_, by the division of\n",
      "the same Empire between the sons of _Constantine_ the great, A.C. 337,\n",
      "_cast out of his mouth water as a flood_, the _Western_ Empire, _after the\n",
      "woman; that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood. And the\n",
      "earth_, or _Greek_ Empire, _helped the woman, and the earth opened her\n",
      "mouth, and swallowed up the flood_, by the victory of _Constantius_ over\n",
      "_Magnentius_, A.C. 353, and thus the Beast was wounded to death with a\n",
      "sword. _And the Dragon was wroth with the woman_, in the reign of _Julian_\n",
      "the Apostate A.C. 361, _and_, by a new division of the Empire between\n",
      "_Valentinian_ and _Valens_, A.C. 364, _went_ from her into the _Eastern_\n",
      "Empire _to make war with the remnant of her seed_, which she left behind\n",
      "her when she fled: and thus the Beast revived. By the next division of the\n",
      "Empire, which was between _Gratian_ and _Theodosius_ A.C. 379, the _Beast_\n",
      "with ten horns _rose out of the sea_, and the _Beast_ with two horns _out\n",
      "of the earth_: and by the last division thereof, which was between the sons\n",
      "of _Theodosius_, A.C. 395, _the Dragon gave the Beast his power and throne,\n",
      "and great authority_. And the ten horns _received power as Kings, the same\n",
      "hour with the Beast_.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the woman arrived at her place of temporal as well as spiritual\n",
      "dominion upon the back of the Beast, where she is nourished _a time, and\n",
      "times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent_; not in his kingdom,\n",
      "but at a distance from him. She is nourished by _the merchants of the\n",
      "earth_, three times or years and an half, or 42 months, or 1260 days: and\n",
      "in these Prophecies days are put for years. During all this time the Beast\n",
      "acted, and _she sat upon him_, that is, reigned over him, and over the ten\n",
      "Kings _who gave their power and strength_, that is, their kingdom _to the\n",
      "Beast_; and she was _drunken with the blood of the Saints_. By all these\n",
      "circumstances she is the eleventh horn of _Daniel_'s fourth Beast, who\n",
      "reigned with _a look more stout than his fellows_, and was of a different\n",
      "kind from the rest, and had eyes _and a mouth_ like the woman; _and made\n",
      "war with the saints, and prevailed against them_, and _wore them out_, and\n",
      "_thought to change times and laws_, and had them _given into his hand,\n",
      "until a time, and times, and half a time_. These characters of the woman,\n",
      "and little horn of the Beast, agree perfectly: in respect of her temporal\n",
      "dominion, she was a horn of the Beast; in respect of her spiritual\n",
      "dominion, she rode upon him in the form of a woman, and was his Church, and\n",
      "committed fornication with the ten Kings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second Beast, which _rose up out of the earth_, was the Church of the\n",
      "_Greek_ Empire: for it _had two horns like those of the Lamb_, and\n",
      "therefore was a Church; and it _spake as the Dragon_, and therefore was of\n",
      "his religion; and it _came up out of the earth_, and by consequence in his\n",
      "kingdom. It is called also _the false Prophet_ who wrought miracles before\n",
      "the first Beast, by which he deceived them that received his mark, and\n",
      "worshiped his image. When the Dragon went from the woman to make war with\n",
      "the remnant of her seed, this Beast arising out of the earth assisted in\n",
      "that war, and _caused the earth and them which dwell therein to worship_\n",
      "the authority of _the first Beast, whose mortal wound was healed_, and to\n",
      "_make an Image to him_, that is, to assemble a body of men like him in\n",
      "point of religion. He had also _power to give life_ and authority _to the\n",
      "Image_, so that it could _both speak, and_ by dictating _cause that all_\n",
      "religious bodies of men, _who would not worship_ the authority of _the\n",
      "Image, should be_ mystically _killed. And he causeth all men to receive a\n",
      "mark in their right hand or in their forehead, and that no man might buy or\n",
      "sell save he that had the mark, or the name of the Beast, or the number of\n",
      "his name_; all the rest being excommunicated by the Beast with two horns.\n",
      "His mark is [Cross] [Cross] [Cross], and his name [Greek: LATEINOS], and\n",
      "the number of his name 666.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the Beast, after he was wounded to death with a sword and revived, was\n",
      "deified, as the heathens used to deify their Kings after death, and had an\n",
      "Image erected to him; and his worshipers were initiated in this new\n",
      "religion, by receiving the mark or name of this new God, or the number of\n",
      "his name. By killing all that will not worship him and his Image, the first\n",
      "Temple, illuminated by the lamps of the seven Churches, is demolished, and\n",
      "a new Temple built for them who will not worship him; and the outward court\n",
      "of this new Temple, or outward form of a Church, is given to the\n",
      "_Gentiles_, who worship the Beast and his Image: while they who will not\n",
      "worship him, are sealed with the name of God in their foreheads, and retire\n",
      "into the inward court of this new Temple. These are the 144000 sealed out\n",

      "incense beaten small; and went into the most holy place within the veil,\n",
      "and put the incense upon the fire, and sprinkled the blood of the bullock\n",

      "a sword, and did live_; that is, that they should call a Council of men of\n",

      "of the Beast, that the image of the Beast should both speak, and cause that\n",
      "as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed_, viz.\n",
      "mystically, by dissolving their Churches. _And he causeth all both small\n",

      "When the seven Angels had poured out the seven vials of wrath, and _John_\n",

      "of the seventh vial to the time of the sixth seal, to take a view of the\n",
      "woman and her Beast, who were to reign in the times of the seventh seal. In\n",
      "respect of the latter part of time of the sixth seal, then considered as\n",
      "present, the Angel tells _John_: _The Beast that thou sawest, was and is\n",
      "not, and shall ascend out of the abyss, and go into perdition_; that is, he\n",
      "was in the reign of _Constans_ and _Magnentius_, until _Constantius_\n",
      "conquered _Magnentius_, and re-united the _Western_ Empire to the\n",
      "_Eastern_. He is not during the reunion, and he shall ascend out of the\n",
      "abyss or sea at a following division of the Empire. The Angel tells him\n",
      "further: _Here is the mind which hath wisdom: the seven heads are seven\n",
      "mountains, on which the woman sitteth_; _Rome_ being built upon seven\n",
      "hills, and thence called the seven-hilled city. _Also there are seven\n",
      "Kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when\n",
      "he cometh, he must continue a short space: and the Beast that was and is\n",
      "not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition_.\n",
      "Five are fallen, the times of the five first seals being past; and one is,\n",
      "the time of the sixth seal being considered as present; and another is not\n",
      "yet come, and when he cometh, which will be at the opening of the seventh\n",
      "seal, he must continue a short space: and the Beast that was and is not,\n",
      "even he is the eighth, by means of the division of the _Roman_ Empire into\n",
      "two collateral Empires; and is of the seven, being one half of the seventh,\n",
      "and shall go into perdition. The words, _five are fallen, and one is, and\n",
      "the other is not yet come_, are usually referred by interpreters to the\n",
      "time of _John_ the Apostle, when the Prophecy was given: but it is to be\n",
      "considered, that in this Prophecy many things are spoken of as present,\n",
      "which were not present when the Prophecy was given, but which would be\n",
      "present with respect to some future time, considered as present in the\n",
      "visions. Thus where it is said upon pouring out the seventh vial of wrath,\n",
      "that _great _Babylon_ came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the\n",
      "cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath_; this relates not to the\n",
      "time of _John_ the Apostle, but to the time of pouring out the seventh vial\n",
      "of wrath. So where it is said, _Babylon is fallen, is fallen_; and _thrust\n",
      "in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come for thee to reap_; and _the\n",
      "time of the dead is come, that they should be judged_; and again, _I saw\n",
      "the dead small and great stand before God_: these sayings relate not to the\n",
      "days of _John_ the Apostle, but to the latter times considered as present\n",
      "in the visions. In like manner the words, _five are fallen, and one is, and\n",
      "the other is not yet come_, and _the Beast that was and is not, he is the\n",
      "eighth_, are not to be referred to the age of _John_ the Apostle, but\n",
      "relate to the time when the Beast was to be wounded to death with a sword,\n",
      "and shew that this wound was to be given him in his sixth head: and without\n",
      "this reference we are not told in what head the Beast was wounded. _And the\n",
      "ten horns which thou sawest, are ten Kings, which have received no kingdom\n",
      "as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast. These have one\n",
      "mind_, being all of the whore's religion, _and shall give their power and\n",
      "strength unto the Beast. These shall make war with the Lamb_, at the\n",

      "fathers, upon pain of death to those who worshiped other Gods; and his son\n",
      "_Jehosaphat_ took away the high places, and in the third year of his reign\n",
      "sent some of his Princes, and of the Priests and Levites, to teach in the\n",
      "cities of _Judah_: and they had the book of the Law with them, and went\n",
      "about throughout all the cities of _Judah_, and taught the people. This is\n",
      "that book of the Law which was afterwards lost in the reign of _Manasses_,\n",
      "and found again in the reign of _Josiah_, and therefore it was written\n",
      "before the third year of _Jehosaphat_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same book of the Law was preserved and handed down to posterity by the\n",
      "_Samaritans_, and therefore was received by the ten Tribes before their\n",
      "captivity. For [6] when the ten Tribes were captivated, a Priest or the\n",
      "captivity was sent back to _Bethel_, by order of the King of _Assyria_, to\n",
      "instruct the new inhabitants of _Samaria_, in _the manner of the God of the\n",
      "land_; and the _Samaritans_ had the _Pentateuch_ from this Priest, as\n",
      "containing the law or _manner of the God of the land_, which he was to\n",
      "teach them. For [7] they persevered in the religion which he taught them,\n",
      "joining with it the worship of their own Gods; and by persevering in what\n",
      "they had been taught, they preserved this book of their Law in the original\n",
      "character of the _Hebrews_, while the two Tribes, after their return from\n",
      "_Babylon_, changed the character to that of the _Chaldees_, which they had\n",
      "learned at _Babylon_.\n",
      "\n",
      "And since the _Pentateuch_ was received as the book of the Law, both by the\n",
      "two Tribes and by the ten Tribes, it follows that they received it before\n",
      "they became divided into two Kingdoms. For after the division, they\n",
      "received not laws from one another, but continued at variance. _Judah_\n",
      "could not reclaim _Israel_ from the sin of _Jeroboam_, and _Israel_ could\n",
      "not bring _Judah_ to it. The _Pentateuch_ therefore was the book of the Law\n",
      "in the days of _David_ and _Solomon_. The affairs of the Tabernacle and\n",
      "Temple were ordered by _David_ and _Solomon_, according to the Law of this\n",
      "book; and _David_ in the 78th Psalm, admonishing the people to give ear to\n",
      "the Law of God, means the Law of this book. For in describing how their\n",
      "forefathers kept it not, he quotes many historical things out of the books\n",
      "of _Exodus_ and _Numbers_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The race of the Kings of _Edom_, before there reigned any King over\n",
      "_Israel_, is set down in the book of [8] _Genesis_; and therefore that book\n",
      "was not written entirely in the form now extant, before the reign of\n",
      "_Saul_. The writer set down the race of those Kings till his own time, and\n",
      "therefore wrote before _David_ conquered _Edom_. The _Pentateuch_ is\n",
      "composed of the Law and the history of God's people together; and the\n",
      "history hath been collected from several books, such as were the history of\n",
      "the Creation composed by _Moses_, _Gen_. ii. 4. the book of the generations\n",
      "of _Adam_, _Gen._ v. i. and the book of the wars of the Lord, _Num._ xxi.\n",
      "14. This book of wars contained what was done at the Red-sea, and in the\n",
      "journeying of _Israel_ thro' the Wilderness, and therefore was begun by\n",
      "_Moses_. And _Joshua_ might carry it on to the conquest of _Canaan_. For\n",
      "_Joshua_ wrote some things in the book of the Law of God, _Josh._ xxiv. 26\n",
      "and therefore might write his own wars in the book of wars, those being the\n",
      "principal wars of God. These were publick books, and therefore not written\n",
      "without the authority of _Moses_ and _Joshua_. And _Samuel_ had leisure in\n",
      "the reign of _Saul_, to put them into the form of the books of _Moses_ and\n",
      "_Joshua_ now extant, inserting into the book of _Genesis_, the race of the\n",
      "Kings of _Edom_, until there reigned a King in _Israel_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book of the _Judges_ is a continued history of the _Judges_ down to the\n",
      "death of _Sampson_, and therefore was compiled after his death, out of the\n",
      "Acts of the _Judges_. Several things in this book are said to be done _when\n",
      "there was no King in _Israel__, _Judg._ xvii. 6. xviii. 1. xix. 1. xxi. 25.\n",
      "and therefore this book was written after the beginning of the reign of\n",
      "_Saul_. When it was written, the _Jebusites_ dwelt in _Jerusalem_, _Jud._\n",
      "i. 21 and therefore it was written before the eighth year of _David_, 2\n",
      "_Sam._ v. 8. and 1 _Chron._ xi. 6. The books of _Moses_, _Joshua_, and\n",
      "_Judges_, contain one continued history, down from the Creation to the\n",

      "_Moses_, _Joshua_, and other records, by one and the same hand, after the\n",
      "beginning of the reign of _Saul_, and before the eighth year of _David_.\n",

      "history of _Moses_ and the _Judges_, 1 _Sam._ xii. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and\n",
      "had leisure in the reign of _Saul_, and sufficient authority to compose\n",
      "these books. He was a Prophet, and judged _Israel_ all the days of his\n",
      "life, and was in the greatest esteem with the people; and the Law by which\n",
      "he was to judge the people was not to be published by less authority than\n",
      "his own, the Law-maker being not inferior to the judge. And the book of\n",
      "_Jasher_, which is quoted in the book of _Joshua_, _Josh._ x. 13. was in\n",

      "the most holy place, there was nothing in it but the two tables, 1 _Kings_\n",
      "viii. 9. and therefore when the _Philistines_ took the Ark, they took out\n",
      "of it the book of the Law, and the golden pot of Manna, and _Aaron_'s Rod.\n",
      "And this and other losses in the desolation of _Israel_, by the conquering\n",

      "The book of _Ruth_ is a history of things done in the days of the _Judges_,\n",
      "and may be looked upon as an addition to the book of the _Judges_, written\n",
      "by the same author, and at the same time. For it was written after the\n",
      "birth of _David_, _Ruth_ iv. 17, 22. and not long after, because the\n",
      "history of _Boaz_ and _Ruth_, the great grandfather and great grandmother\n",
      "of _David_, and that of their contemporaries, could not well be remembered\n",
      "above two or three generations. And since this book derives the genealogy\n",
      "of _David_ from _Boaz_ and _Ruth_, and omits _David_'s elder brothers and\n",
      "his sons; it was written in honour of _David_, after he was anointed King\n",
      "by _Samuel_, and before he had children in _Hebron_, and by consequence in\n",
      "the reign of _Saul_. It proceeds not to the history of _David_, and\n",
      "therefore seems to have been written presently after he was anointed. They\n",
      "judge well therefore who ascribe to _Samuel_ the books of _Joshua_,\n",
      "_Judges_, and _Ruth_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Samuel_ is also reputed the author of the first book of _Samuel_, till the\n",
      "time of his death. The two books of _Samuel_ cite no authors, and therefore\n",
      "seem to be originals. They begin with his genealogy, birth and education,\n",
      "and might be written partly in his lifetime by himself or his disciples the\n",
      "Prophets at _Naioth_ in _Ramah_, 1 _Sam._ xix. 18, 19, 20. and partly after\n",
      "his death by the same disciples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The books of the _Kings_ cite other authors, as the book of the Acts of\n",
      "_Solomon_, the book of the _Chronicles_ of the Kings of _Israel_, and the\n",
      "book of the _Chronicles_ of the Kings of _Judah_. The books of the\n",
      "_Chronicles_ cite the book of _Samuel_ the Seer, the book of _Nathan_ the\n",
      "Prophet, and the book of _Gad_ the Seer, for the Acts of _David_; the book\n",
      "of _Nathan_ the Prophet, the Prophecy of _Ahijah_ the _Shilonite_, and the\n",
      "visions of _Iddo_ the Seer, for the Acts of _Solomon_; the book of\n",
      "_Shemajah_ the Prophet, and the book of _Iddo_ the Seer concerning\n",
      "genealogies, for the Acts of _Rehoboam_ and _Abijah_; the book of the Kings\n",
      "of _Judah_ and _Israel_ for the Acts of _Asa_, _Joash_, _Amaziah_,\n",
      "_Jotham_, _Ahaz_, _Hezekiah_, _Manasseh_, and _Josiah_; the book of\n",
      "_Hanani_ the Seer, for the Acts of _Jehosaphat_; and the visions of\n",
      "_Isaiah_ for the Acts of _Uzziah_ and _Hezekiah_. These books were\n",
      "therefore collected out of the historical writings of the antient Seers and\n",
      "Prophets. And because the books of the _Kings_ and _Chronicles_ quote one\n",
      "another, they were written at one and the same time. And this time was\n",
      "after the return from the _Babylonian_ captivity, because they bring down\n",
      "the history of _Judah_, and the genealogies of the Kings of _Judah_, and of\n",
      "the High Priests, to that captivity. The book of _Ezra_ was originally a\n",
      "part of the book of the _Chronicles_, and has been divided from it. For it\n",
      "begins with the two last verses of the books of _Chronicles_, and the first\n",
      "book of _Esdras_ begins with the two last chapters thereof. _Ezra_ was\n",
      "therefore the compiler of the books of _Kings_ and _Chronicles_, and\n",
      "brought down the history to his own time. He was a ready Scribe in the Law\n",
      "of God; and for assisting him in this work _Nehemias_ founded a library,\n",
      "and _gathered together the Acts of the Kings and the Prophets, and of\n",
      "_David_, and the Epistles of the Kings, concerning the holy gifts_, 2\n",
      "_Maccab._ ii. 13. By the Acts of _David_ I understand here the two books of\n",
      "_Samuel_, or at least the second book. Out of the Acts of the _Kings_,\n",
      "written from time to time by the Prophets, he compos'd the books of the\n",
      "Kings of _Judah_ and _Israel_, the _Chronicles_ of the Kings of _Judah_,\n",
      "and the _Chronicles_ of the Kings of _Israel_. And in doing this he joined\n",
      "those Acts together, in due order of time, copying the very words of the\n",
      "authors, as is manifest from hence, that the books of the _Kings_ and\n",
      "_Chronicles_ frequently agree with one another in words for many sentences\n",
      "together. Where they agree in sense, there they agree in words also.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Prophecies of _Isaiah_, written at several times, he has collected\n",
      "into one body. And the like he did for those of _Jeremiah_, and the rest of\n",
      "the Prophets, down to the days of the second Temple. The book of _Jonah_ is\n",
      "the history of _Jonah_ written by another hand. The book of _Daniel_ is a\n",
      "collection of papers written at several times. The six last chapters\n",
      "contain Prophecies written at several times by _Daniel_ himself: the six\n",
      "first are a collection of historical papers written by others. The fourth\n",
      "chapter is a decree of _Nebuchadnezzar_. The first chapter was written\n",
      "after _Daniel_'s death: for the author saith, that _Daniel_ continued to\n",
      "the first year of _Cyrus_; that is, to his first year over the _Persians_\n",
      "and _Medes_, and third year over _Babylon_. And, for the same reason, the\n",
      "fifth and sixth chapters were also written after his death. For they end\n",
      "with these words: _So this _Daniel_ prospered in the reign of _Darius_ and\n",
      "in the reign of _Cyrus_ the_ Persian. Yet these words might be added by the\n",
      "collector of the papers, whom I take to be _Ezra_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Psalms composed by _Moses_, _David_, and others, seem to have been also\n",
      "collected by _Ezra_ into one volume. I reckon him the collector, because in\n",
      "this collection I meet with Psalms as late as the _Babylonian_ captivity,\n",
      "but with none later.\n",
      "\n",
      "After these things _Antiochus Epiphanes_ spoiled the Temple, commanded the\n",
      "_Jews_ to forsake the Law upon pain of death, and caused the sacred books\n",
      "to be burnt wherever they could be found: and in these troubles the book of\n",
      "the _Chronicles_ of the Kings of _Israel_ was entirely lost. But upon\n",
      "recovering from this oppression, _Judas MaccabÃ¦us_ gathered together all\n",
      "those writings that were to be met with, 2 _Maccab._ ii. 14. and in\n",
      "reducing them into order, part of the Prophecies of _Isaiah_, or some other\n",
      "Prophet, have been added to the end of the Prophecies of _Zechariah_; and\n",
      "the book of _Ezra_ has been separated from the book of _Chronicles_, and\n",
      "set together in two different orders; in one order in the book of _Ezra_,\n",
      "received into the Canon, and in another order in the first book of\n",

      "After the _Roman_ captivity, the _Jews_ for preserving their traditions,\n",
      "put them in writing in their _Talmud_, and for preserving their scriptures,\n",

      "sort in every book: and by preserving only this Edition, the antienter\n",
      "various lections, except what can be discovered by means of the\n",

      "Tabernacles: for he had not yet collected the writings of the Prophets into\n",
      "the volume now extant; but instituted the reading of them after the\n",
      "collection was made. By reading the Law and the Prophets in the Synagogues,\n",
      "those books have been kept freer from corruption than the _Hagiographa_.\n",

      "In the infancy of the nation of _Israel_, when God had given them a Law,\n",
      "and made a covenant with them to be their God if they would keep his\n",

      "to the worship of other Gods: and upon their returning to him, they\n",
      "sometimes renewed the covenant which they had broken. These Prophets he\n",
      "continued to send, till the days of _Ezra_: but after their Prophecies were\n",
      "read in the Synagogues, those Prophecies were thought sufficient. For if\n",
      "the people would not hear _Moses_ and the old Prophets, they would hear no\n",
      "new ones, no not _tho they should rise from the dead_. At length when a new\n",
      "truth was to be preached to the _Gentiles_, namely, _that Jesus was the\n",
      "Christ_, God sent new Prophets and Teachers: but after their writings were\n",
      "also received and read in the Synagogues of the Christians, Prophecy ceased\n",
      "a second time. We have _Moses_, the Prophets, and Apostles, and the words\n",
      "of Christ himself; and if we will not hear them, we shall be more\n",
      "inexcusable than the _Jews._ For the Prophets and Apostles have foretold,\n",

      "renewed it; so there should be a falling away among the Christians, soon\n",
      "after the days of the Apostles; and that in the latter days God would\n",
      "destroy the impenitent revolters, and make a new covenant with his people.\n",
      "And the giving ear to the Prophets is a fundamental character of the true\n",
      "Church. For God has so ordered the Prophecies, that in the latter days _the\n",

      "_Of the Prophetic Language._\n",
      "\n",
      "For understanding the Prophecies, we are, in the first place, to acquaint\n",
      "our-selves with the figurative language of the Prophets. This language is\n",
      "taken from the analogy between the world natural, and an empire or kingdom\n",
      "considered as a world politic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the whole world natural consisting of heaven and earth,\n",
      "signifies the whole world politic, consisting of thrones and people, or so\n",
      "much of it as is considered in the Prophecy: and the things in that world\n",
      "signify the analogous things in this. For the heavens, and the things\n",
      "therein, signify thrones and dignities, and those who enjoy them; and the\n",
      "earth, with the things thereon, the inferior people; and the lowest parts\n",
      "of the earth, called _Hades_ or Hell, the lowest or most miserable part of\n",
      "them. Whence ascending towards heaven, and descending to the earth, are put\n",
      "for rising and falling in power and honour: rising out of the earth, or\n",
      "waters, and falling into them, for the rising up to any dignity or\n",
      "dominion, out of the inferior state of the people, or falling down from the\n",
      "same into that inferior state; descending into the lower parts of the\n",
      "earth, for descending to a very low and unhappy estate; speaking with a\n",
      "faint voice out of the dust, for being in a weak and low condition; moving\n",
      "from one place to another, for translation from one office, dignity, or\n",
      "dominion, to another; great earthquakes, and the shaking of heaven and\n",
      "earth, for the shaking of kingdoms, so as to distract or overthrow them;\n",
      "the creating a new heaven and earth, and the passing away of an old one, or\n",
      "the beginning and end of the world, for the rise and ruin of the body\n",
      "politic signified thereby.\n",

      "In the heavens, the Sun and Moon are, by interpreters of dreams, put for\n",

      "the kingdom or kingdoms of the world politic, shining with regal power and\n",
      "glory; the Moon for the body of the common people, considered as the King's\n",

      "prayed for in the Churches of _Rome_. His image was henceforward put upon\n",

      "its Senate, and both under the Pope and himself. But hearing that his new\n",
      "laws were not observed by the judges in dictating the law, nor by the\n",
      "people in hearing it; and that the great men took servants from free men,\n",
      "and from the Churches and Monasteries, to labour in their vineyards,\n",
      "fields, pastures and houses, and continued to exact cattle and wine of\n",
      "them, and to oppress those that served the Churches: he wrote to his son\n",

      "Now the Senate and people and principality of _Rome_ I take to be the third\n",

      "people elected the Pope and the Emperor; and now, by electing the Emperor\n",
      "and making him Consul, was acknowledged to retain the authority of the old\n",
      "_Roman_ Senate and people. This city was the Metropolis of the old _Roman_\n",
      "Empire, represented in _Daniel_ by the fourth Beast; and by subduing the\n",
      "Senate and people and Duchy, it became the Metropolis of the little horn of\n",
      "that Beast, and completed _Peter_'s Patrimony, which was the kingdom of\n",
      "that horn. Besides, this victory was attended with greater consequences\n",
      "than those over the other two Kings. For it set up the _Western Empire_,\n",
      "which continues to this day. It set up the Pope above the judicature of the\n",
      "_Roman_ Senate, and above that of a Council of _Italian_ and _French_\n",
      "Bishops, and even above all human judicature; and gave him the supremacy\n",
      "over the _Western_ Churches and their Councils in a high degree. It gave\n",
      "him _a look more stout than his fellows_; so that when this new religion\n",
      "began to be established in the minds of men, he grappled not only with\n",
      "Kings, but even with the _Western_ Emperor himself. It is observable also,\n",
      "that the custom of kissing the Pope's feet, an honour superior to that of\n",
      "Kings and Emperors, began about this time. There are some instances of it\n",
      "in the ninth century: _Platina_ tells us, that the feet of Pope _Leo_ IV\n",
      "were kissed, according to antient custom, by all who came to him: and some\n",
      "say that _Leo_ III began this custom, pretending that his hand was infected\n",
      "by the kiss of a woman. The Popes began also about this time to canonize\n",
      "saints, and to grant indulgences and pardons: and some represent that _Leo_\n",
      "III was the first author of all these things. It is further observable,\n",
      "that _Charles_ the great, between the years 775 and 796, conquered all\n",
      "_Germany_ from the _Rhine_ and _Danube_ northward to the _Baltic_ sea, and\n",
      "eastward to the river _Teis_; extending his conquests also into _Spain_ as\n",
      "far as the river _Ebro_: and by these conquests he laid the foundation of\n",
      "the new Empire; and at the same time propagated the _Roman_ Catholic\n",
      "religion into all his conquests, obliging the _Saxons_ and _Hunns_ who were\n",
      "heathens, to receive the _Roman_ faith, and distributing his northern\n",
      "conquests into Bishopricks, granting tithes to the Clergy and _Peter-pence_\n",
      "to the Pope: by all which the Church of _Rome_ was highly enlarged,\n",
      "enriched, exalted, and established.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the forementioned _dissertation upon some coins of _Charles_ the great,\n",
      "_Ludovicus Pius_, _Lotharius_, and their successors, stamped at _Rome__,\n",

      "his sending the standard or banner of the city of _Rome_ curiously wrought,\n",
      "to _Charles_ the great; and which still remained there at the publishing of\n",
      "the said book. In the _Mosaic_ work there appeared _Peter_ with three keys\n",

      "God would preserve the life of the Pope, and give victory to the King over\n",
      "the _Romans_. The three keys in the lap of _Peter_ signify the keys of the\n",

      "St. _Peter_, and whose Crowns are now worn by the Pope, and by the conquest\n",

      "to the King with his left, and by naming the Pope before the King in the\n",

      "The second and third Empires, represented by the Bear and Leopard, are\n",
      "again represented by the Ram and He-Goat; but with this difference, that\n",

      "beginning of the four Empires, and the Goat represents the kingdom of the\n",
      "_Greeks_ to the end of them. By this means, under the type of the Ram and\n",
      "He-Goat, the times of all the four Empires are again described: _I lifted\n",

      "before the river_ [Ulai] _a Ram which had two horns, and the two horns were\n",
      "high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.--And\n",
      "the Ram having two horns, are the kings of _Media_ and _Persia__: not two\n",
      "persons but two kingdoms, the kingdoms of _Media_ and _Persia_; and the\n",
      "kingdom of _Persia_ was the higher horn and came up last. The kingdom of\n",
      "_Persia_ rose up, when _Cyrus_ having newly conquered _Babylon_, revolted\n",
      "from _Darius_ King of the _Medes_, and beat him at _PasargadÃ¦_, and set up\n",
      "the _Persians_ above the _Medes_. This was the horn which came up last. And\n",
      "the horn which came up first was the kingdom of the _Medes_, from the time\n",
      "that _Cyaxares_ and _Nebuchadnezzar_ overthrew _Nineveh_, and shared the\n",
      "Empire of the _Assyrians_ between them. The Empires of _Media_ and\n",
      "_Babylon_ were contemporary, and rose up together by the fall of the\n",
      "_Assyrian_ Empire; and the Prophecy of the four Beasts begins with one of\n",
      "them, and that of the Ram and He-Goat with the other. As the Ram represents\n",
      "the kingdom of _Media_ and _Persia_ from the beginning of the four Empires;\n",
      "so the He-Goat represents the Empire of the _Greeks_ to the end of those\n",
      "Monarchies. In the reign of his great horn, and of the four horns which\n",
      "succeeded it, he represents this Empire during the reign of the Leopard:\n",
      "and in the reign of his little horn, which stood up in the latter time of\n",
      "the kingdom of the four, and after their fall became mighty but not by his\n",

      "that which was founded by _Alexander_ the great, _An. Nabonass._ 414, and\n",

      "reigning in his four heads, signifies the same thing with the He-Goat\n",
      "reigning in his four horns: and therefore the He-Goat reigned in his four\n",
      "horns till the rise of _Daniel_'s fourth Beast, or Empire of the _Latins_:\n",

      "Beast, the power of the fourth Beast. And such a little horn was the\n",
      "kingdom of _Macedonia_, from the time that it became subject to the\n",
      "_Romans_. This kingdom, by the victory of the _Romans_ over _Persius_ King\n",
      "of _Macedonia_, _Anno Nabonass._ 580, ceased to be one of the four horns of\n",

      "the last horn of the Goat continued mighty under the _Romans_, till the\n",
      "reign of _Constantine_ the great and his sons: and then by the division of\n",
      "the _Roman_ Empire between the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Emperors, it separated\n",
      "from the _Latins_, and became the _Greek_ Empire alone, but yet under the\n",

      "always signifies a new kingdom, and the kingdom of _Antiochus_ was an old\n",
      "one. _Antiochus_ reigned over one of the four horns, and the little horn\n",
      "was a fifth under its proper kings. This horn was at first a little one,\n",
      "and waxed exceeding great, but so did not _Antiochus_. It is described\n",
      "great above all the former horns, and so was not _Antiochus_. His kingdom\n",
      "on the contrary was weak, and tributary to the _Romans_, and he did not\n",
      "enlarge it. The horn was a _King of fierce countenance, and destroyed\n",
      "wonderfully, and prospered and practised_; that is, he prospered in his\n",

      "_Egypt_ by a mere message of the _Romans_, and afterwards routed and\n",
      "baffled by the _Jews_. The horn was mighty by another's power, _Antiochus_\n",
      "acted by his own. The horn stood up against the Prince of the Host of\n",
      "heaven, the Prince of Princes; and this is the character not of _Antiochus_\n",
      "but of _Antichrist_. The horn cast down the Sanctuary to the ground, and so\n",
      "did not _Antiochus_; he left it standing. The Sanctuary and Host were\n",
      "trampled under foot 2300 days; and in _Daniel_'s Prophecies days are put\n",
      "for years: but the profanation of the Temple in the reign of _Antiochus_\n",

      "where in these Prophecies of _Daniel_ put for the military power of a\n",

      "had instructed them a year, lent them to preach in the cities of the\n",
      "_Jews_: at the same time _John_ hearing of the fame of _Christ_, sent to\n",
      "him to know who he was. At the third, the chief Priests began to consult\n",
      "about the death of _Christ_. A little before the fourth, the twelve after\n",

      "fear of the _Jews_, who at the Passover before had consulted his death, and\n",
      "because his time was not yet come. Thenceforward therefore till the feast\n",
      "of Tabernacles he walked in _Galilee_, and that secretly for fear of\n",
      "_Herod_: and after the feast of Tabernacles he returned no more into\n",

      "imprisoned; and now his course being at an end, _Christ_ entered upon his\n",
      "proper office of preaching in the cities. In the beginning of his preaching\n",
      "he completed the number of the twelve Apostles, and instructed them all the\n",
      "first year in order to send them abroad. Before the end of this year, his\n",
      "fame by his preaching and miracles was so far spread abroad, that the\n",
      "_Jews_ at the Passover following consulted how to kill him. In the second\n",
      "year of his preaching, it being no longer safe for him to converse openly\n",
      "in _Judea_, he sent the twelve to preach in all their cities: and in the\n",

      "that they cannot be mistaken. The second Passover is distinguished from the\n",
      "first, by the interposition of _John_'s imprisonment. The third is\n",
      "distinguished from the second, by a double character: first, by the\n",
      "interposition of the feast to which _Christ_ went up, _Mat._ viii. 19.\n",
      "_Luke_ ix. 57. and secondly, by the distance of time from the beginning of\n",
      "_Christ_'s preaching: for the second was in the beginning of his preaching,\n",
      "and the third so long after, that before it came _Christ_ said, _from the\n",
      "days of _John_ the Baptist until now_, &c. and upbraided the cities of\n",
      "_Galilee_ for their not repenting at his preaching, and mighty works done\n",
      "in all that time. The fourth is distinguished from the third, by the\n",
      "mission of the twelve from _Christ_ to preach in the cities of _Judea_ in\n",
      "all the interval. The fifth is distinguished from all the former by the\n",
      "twelve's being returned from preaching, and continuing with _Christ_ during\n",
      "all the interval, between the fourth and fifth, and by the passion and\n",
      "other infallible characters.\n",

      "sixth hour at evening, that is, at sun set, next after the eighteenth hour\n",
      "from the conjunction. And this rule they called [Hebrew: YH] _Jah_,\n",

      "did not anticipate, but postpone their months: they thought it lawful to\n",
      "begin their months a day later than the first appearance of the new moon,\n",
      "because the new moon continued for more days than one; but not a day\n",
      "sooner, lest they should celebrate the new moon before there was any. And\n",
      "the _Jews_ still keep a tradition in their books, that the _Sanhedrim_ used\n",

      "In the first ages of the Christian religion the Christians of every city\n",
      "were governed by a Council of Presbyters, and the President of the Council\n",
      "was the Bishop of the city. The Bishop and Presbyters of one city meddled\n",
      "not with the affairs of another city, except by admonitory letters or\n",
      "messages. Nor did the Bishops of several cities meet together in Council\n",
      "before the time of the Emperor _Commodus_: for they could not meet together\n",
      "without the leave of the _Roman_ governors of the Provinces. But in the\n",
      "days of that Emperor they began to meet in Provincial Councils, by the\n",
      "leave of the governors; first in _Asia_, in opposition to the\n",
      "_Cataphrygian_ Heresy, and soon after in other places and upon other\n",
      "occasions. The Bishop of the chief city, or Metropolis of the _Roman_\n",
      "Province, was usually made President of the Council; and hence came the\n",
      "authority of Metropolitan Bishops above that of other Bishops within the\n",
      "same Province. Hence also it was that the Bishop of _Rome_ in _Cyprian_'s\n",
      "days called himself the Bishop of Bishops. As soon as the Empire became\n",
      "Christian, the _Roman_ Emperors began to call general Councils out of all\n",
      "the Provinces of the Empire; and by prescribing to them what points they\n",
      "should consider, and influencing them by their interest and power, they set\n",
      "up what party they pleased. Hereby the _Greek_ Empire, upon the division of\n",
      "the _Roman_ Empire into the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires, became _the King\n",
      "who_, in matters of religion, _did according to his will_; _and_, in\n",
      "legislature, _exalted and magnified himself above every God_: and at\n",
      "length, by the seventh general Council, established the worship of the\n",
      "images and souls of dead men, here called _Mahuzzims_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same King placed holiness in abstinence from marriage. _Eusebius_ in\n",
      "his Ecclesiastical history [1] tells us, that _Musanus_ wrote a tract\n",
      "against those who fell away to the heresy of the _Encratites_, which was\n",
      "then newly risen, and had introduced pernicious errors; and that _Tatian_,\n",
      "the disciple of _Justin_, was the author thereof; and that _IrenÃ¦us_ in his\n",

      "followers of _Tatian_ were at first condemned as hereticks by the name of\n",
      "_Encratites_, or _Continentes_; their principles could not be yet quite\n",
      "exploded: for _Montanus_ refined upon them, and made only second marriages\n",
      "unlawful; he also introduced frequent fastings, and annual, fasting days,\n",
      "the keeping of _Lent_, and feeding upon dried meats. The _Apostolici_,\n",
      "about the middle of the third century, condemned marriage, and were a\n",
      "branch of the disciples of _Tatian_. The _HierocitÃ¦_ in _Egypt_, in the\n",
      "latter end of the third century, also condemned marriage. _Paul_ the\n",
      "_Eremite_ fled into the wilderness from the persecution of _Decius_, and\n",
      "lived there a solitary life till the reign of _Constantine_ the great, but\n",
      "made no disciples. _Antony_ did the like in the persecution of\n",
      "_Dioclesian_, or a little before, and made disciples; and many others soon\n",
      "followed his example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitherto the principles of the _Encratites_ had been rejected by the\n",
      "Churches; but now being refined by the Monks, and imposed not upon all men,\n",
      "but only upon those who would voluntarily undertake a monastic life, they\n",
      "began to be admired, and to overflow first the _Greek_ Church, and then the\n",
      "_Latin_ also, like a torrent. _Eusebius_ tells us, [2] that _Constantine_\n",

      "\n",
      "In scripture we are told of some _trusting in God_ and others _trusting in\n",
      "idols_, and that _God is our refuge, our strength, our defense_. In this\n",
      "sense God is _the rock of his people_, and false Gods are called _the rock\n",
      "of those that trust in them_, Deut. xxxii. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37. In the\n",
      "same sense the Gods of _the King_ who _shall do according to his will_ are\n",
      "called _Mahuzzims_, munitions, fortresses, protectors, guardians, or\n",
      "defenders. _In his estate_, saith [1] _Daniel_, _shall he honour\n",
      "_Mahuzzims_; even with a God whom his fathers knew not, shall he honour\n",
      "them with gold and silver, and with precious stones, and things of value.\n",
      "Thus shall he do in the most strong holds_ or temples;--_and he shall cause\n",
      "them to rule over many, and divide the land_ among them _for a possession_.\n",
      "Now this came to pass by degrees in the following manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Gregory Nyssen_ [2] tells us, that after the persecution of the Emperor\n",
      "_Decius_, _Gregory_ Bishop of _NeocÃ¦sarea_ in _Pontus_, _instituted among\n",
      "all people, as an addition or corollary of devotion towards God, that\n",
      "festival days and assemblies should be celebrated to them who had contended\n",
      "for the faith_, that is, to the _Martyrs_. And he adds this reason for the\n",
      "institution: _When he observed_, saith _Nyssen_, _that the simple and\n",
      "unskilful multitude, by reason of corporeal delights, remained in the error\n",
      "of idols; that the principal thing might be corrected among them, namely,\n",
      "that instead of their vain worship they might turn their eyes upon God; he\n",
      "permitted that at the memories of the holy Martyrs they might make merry\n",
      "and delight themselves, and be dissolved into joy_. The heathens were\n",
      "delighted with the festivals of their Gods, and unwilling to part with\n",
      "those delights; and therefore _Gregory_, to facilitate their conversion,\n",
      "instituted annual festivals to the _Saints_ and _Martyrs_. Hence it came to\n",
      "pass, that for exploding the festivals of the heathens, the principal\n",
      "festivals of the _Christians_ succeeded in their room: as the keeping of\n",
      "_Christmas_ with ivy and feasting, and playing and sports, in the room of\n",
      "the _Bacchanalia_ and _Saturnalia_; the celebrating of _May-day_ with\n",
      "flowers, in the room of the _Floralia_; and the keeping of festivals to the\n",
      "Virgin _Mary_, _John_ the Baptist, and divers of the Apostles, in the room\n",
      "of the solemnities at the entrance of the Sun into the signs of the\n",
      "_Zodiac_ in the old _Julian_ Calendar. In the same persecution of _Decius_,\n",
      "_Cyprian_ ordered the passions of the Martyrs in _Africa_ to be registred,\n",
      "in order to celebrate their memories annually with oblations and\n",
      "sacrifices: and _Felix_ Bishop of _Rome_, a little after, as _Platina_\n",
      "relates, _Martyrum gloria consulens, constituit at quotannis sacrificia\n",
      "eorum nomine celebrarentur_; \"consulting the glory of the Martyrs, ordained\n",
      "that sacrifices should be celebrated annually in their name.\" By the\n",
      "pleasures of these festivals the _Christians_ increased much in number, and\n",
      "decreased as much in virtue, until they were _purged and made white_ by the\n",
      "persecution of _Dioclesian_. This was the first step made in the\n",
      "_Christian_ religion towards the veneration of the Martyrs: and tho it did\n",
      "not yet amount to an unlawful worship; yet it disposed the _Christians_\n",
      "towards such a further veneration of the dead, as in a short time ended in\n",
      "the invocation of Saints.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step was the affecting to pray at the sepulchres of the Martyrs:\n",
      "which practice began in _Dioclesian_'s persecution. The Council of\n",
      "_Eliberis_ in _Spain_, celebrated in the third or fourth year of\n",
      "_Dioclesian_'s persecution, A.C. 305, hath these Canons. Can. 34. _Cereos\n",

      "the Council of _Laodicea_ in _Phrygia_, which then met for restoring the\n",
      "lapsed discipline of the Church, has the following Canons. Can. 9. _Those\n",
      "of the Church are not allowed to go into the _Coemeteries_ or _Martyries_,\n",
      "as they are called, of hereticks, for the sake of prayer or recovery of\n",
      "health: but such as go, if they be of the faithful, shall be excommunicated\n",

      "hereticks; _for these are alien from God: and therefore let those be\n",

      "be celebrated in _Lent_, but their commemoration shall be made on the\n",
      "Sabbath-days and Lords days_. The Council of _Paphlagonia_, celebrated in\n",
      "the year 324, made this Canon: _If any man being arrogant, abominates the\n",
      "congregations of the Martyrs, or the Liturgies performed therein, or the\n",
      "memories of the Martyrs, let him be anathema_. By all which it is manifest\n",
      "that the _Christians_ in the time of _Dioclesian_'s persecution used to\n",
      "pray in the _Coemeteries_ or burying-places of the dead; for avoiding the\n",
      "danger of the persecution, and for want of Churches, which were all thrown\n",
      "down: and after the persecution was over, continued that practice in honour\n",
      "of the Martyrs, till new Churches could be built: and by use affected it as\n",
      "advantageous to devotion, and for recovering the health of those that were\n",
      "sick. It also appears that in these burying-places they commemorated the\n",
      "Martyrs yearly upon days dedicated to them, and accounted all these\n",
      "practices pious and religious, and anathematized those men as arrogant who\n",
      "opposed them, or prayed in the _Martyries_ of the hereticks. They also\n",
      "lighted torches to the Martyrs in the day-time, as the heathens did to\n",
      "their Gods; which custom, before the end of the fourth century, prevailed\n",
      "much in the _West_. They sprinkled the worshipers of the Martyrs with\n",
      "holy-water, as the heathens did the worshipers of their Gods; and went in\n",
      "pilgrimage to see _Jerusalem_ and other holy places, as if those places\n",
      "conferred sanctity on the visiters. From the custom of praying in the\n",
      "_Coemeteries_ and _Martyries_, came the custom of translating the bodies of\n",
      "the Saints and Martyrs into such Churches as were new built: the Emperor\n",
      "_Constantius_ began this practice about the year 359, causing the bodies of\n",
      "_Andrew_ the Apostle, _Luke_ and _Timothy_, to be translated into a new\n",
      "Church at _Constantinople_: and before this act of _Constantius_, the\n",
      "_Egyptians_ kept the bodies of their Martyrs and Saints unburied upon beds\n",
      "in their private houses, and told stories of their souls appearing after\n",
      "death and ascending up to heaven, as _Athanasius_ relates in the life of\n",
      "_Antony_. All which gave occasion to the Emperor _Julian_, as _Cyril_\n",
      "relates, to accuse the _Christians_ in this manner: _Your adding to that\n",
      "antient dead man, Jesus, many new dead men, who can sufficiently abominate?\n",
      "You have filled all places with sepulchres and monuments, altho you are no\n",
      "where bidden to prostrate yourselves to sepulchres, and to respect them\n",
      "officiously._ And a little after: _Since _Jesus_ said that sepulchres are\n",
      "full of filthiness, how do you invoke God upon them_? and in another place\n",
      "he saith, that if _Christians_ had adhered to the precepts of the\n",
      "_Hebrews_, _they would have worshiped one God instead of many, and not a\n",
      "man, or rather not many unhappy men_: And that they _adored the wood of the\n",
      "cross, making its images on their foreheads, and before their houses_.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the sepulchres of Saints and Martyrs were thus converted into places\n",
      "of worship like the heathen temples, and the Churches into sepulchres, and\n",
      "a certain sort of sanctity attributed to the dead bodies of the Saints and\n",
      "Martyrs buried in them, and annual festivals were kept to them, with\n",
      "sacrifices offered to God in their name; the next step towards the\n",
      "invocation of Saints, was the attributing to their dead bodies, bones and\n",
      "other reliques, a power of working miracles, by means of the separate\n",
      "souls, who were supposed to know what we do or say, and to be able to do us\n",
      "good or hurt, and to work those miracles. This was the very notion the\n",
      "heathens had of the separate souls of their antient Kings and Heroes, whom\n",
      "they worshiped under the names of _Saturn_, _Rhea_, _Jupiter_, _Juno_,\n",
      "_Mars_, _Venus_, _Bacchus_, _Ceres_, _Osiris_, _Isis_, _Apollo_, _Diana_,\n",
      "and the rest of their Gods. For these Gods being male and female, husband\n",
      "and wife, son and daughter, brother and sister, are thereby discovered to\n",
      "be antient men and women. Now as the first step towards the invocation of\n",
      "Saints was set on foot by the persecution of _Decius_, and the second by\n",
      "the persecution of _Dioclesian_; so this third seems to have been owing to\n",
      "the proceedings of _Constantius_ and _Julian_ the Apostate. When _Julian_\n",
      "began to restore the worship of the heathen Gods, and to vilify the Saints\n",
      "and Martyrs; the _Christians_ of _Syria_ and _Egypt_ seem to have made a\n",
      "great noise about the miracles done by the reliques of the _Christian_\n",
      "Saints and Martyrs, in opposition to the powers attributed by _Julian_ and\n",
      "the heathens to their Idols. For _Sozomen_ and _Ruffinus_ tell us, that\n",
      "when he opened the heathen Temples, and consulted the Oracle of _Apollo\n",
      "DaphnÃ¦us_ in the suburbs of _Antioch_, and pressed by many sacrifices for\n",
      "an answer; the Oracle at length told him that the bones of the Martyr\n",
      "_Babylas_ which were buried there hinder'd him from speaking. By which\n",
      "answer we may understand, that some _Christian_ was got into the place\n",
      "where the heathen Priests used to speak thro' a pipe in delivering their\n",
      "Oracles: and before this, _Hilary_ in his book against _Constantius_,\n",
      "written in the last year of that Emperor, makes the following mention of\n",
      "what was then doing in the _East_ where he was. _Sine martyrio persequeris.\n",
      "Plus crudelitati vestrÃ¦ _Nero_, _Deci_, _Maximiane_, debemus. Diabolum enim\n",
      "per vos vicimus. Sanctus ubique beatorum martyrum sanguis exceptus est, dum\n",

      "non defluere in faciem, uri sine ignibus spiritus, confiteri sine\n",
      "interrogantis incremento fidei_. And _Gregory Nazianzen_, in his first\n",
      "Oration against the Emperor _Julian_ then reigning, writes thus: _Martyres\n",
      "non extimuisti quibus prÃ¦clari honores & festa constituta, Ã  quibus DÃ¦mones\n",
      "propelluntur & morbi curantur; quorum sunt apparitiones & prÃ¦dictiones;\n",
      "quorum vel sola corpora idem possunt quod animÃ¦ sanctÃ¦, sive manibus\n",
      "contrectentur, sive honorentur: quorum vel solÃ¦ sanguinis guttÃ¦ atque\n",
      "exigua passionis signa idem possunt quod corpora. HÃ¦c non colis sed\n",
      "contemnis & aspernaris_. These things made the heathens in the reign of the\n",
      "same Emperor demolish the sepulchre of _John_ the Baptist in _Phoenicia_,\n",
      "and burn his bones; when several _Christians_ mixing themselves with the\n",
      "heathens, gathered up some of his remains, which were sent to _Athanasius_,\n",
      "who hid them in the wall of a Church; foreseeing by a prophetic spirit, as\n",
      "_Ruffinus_ tells us, that they might be profitable to future generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cry of these miracles being once set on foot, continued for many years,\n",
      "and encreased and grew more general. _Chrysostom_, in his second Oration on\n",
      "St. _Babylas_, twenty years after the silencing of the Oracle of _Apollo\n",
      "DaphnÃ¦us_ as above, viz. A.C. 382, saith of the miracles done by the Saints\n",

      "figmenta fuissent, prorsus in tantam hominum admirationem non venissent_.\n",
      "And a little after: _Abunde orationi nostrÃ¦ fidem faciunt quÃ¦ quotidiana Ã \n",
      "martyribus miracula eduntur, magna affatim ad illa hominum multitudine\n",
      "affluente_. And in his 66th Homily, describing how the Devils were\n",
      "tormented and cast out by the bones of the Martyrs, he adds: _Ob eam causam\n",

      "_East_, that is, before the year 381, in which _Constantinople_ became the\n",

      "_Antioch_ followed the example of _Egypt_, in dispersing the reliques of\n",
      "the forty Martyrs: and the examples of _Egypt_ and _Syria_ were soon\n",
      "followed by the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reliques of the forty Martyrs at _Antioch_ were distributed among the\n",
      "Churches before the year 373; for _Athanasius_ who died in that year, wrote\n",
      "an Oration upon them. This Oration is not yet published, but _Gerard\n",

      "forty Martyrs. Now since the Monks of _Alexandria_ sent the reliques of the\n",
      "Martyrs of _Egypt_ into all parts of the earth, and thereby acquired glory\n",
      "to their city, and declared her in these matters the Metropolis of the\n",
      "whole world, as we have observed out of _Chrysostom_; it may be concluded,\n",
      "that before _Alexandria_ received the forty Martyrs from _Antioch_, she\n",
      "began to send out the reliques of her own Martyrs into all parts, setting\n",
      "the first example to other cities. This practice therefore began in _Egypt_\n",
      "some years before the death of _Athanasius_. It began when the\n",
      "miracle-working bones of _John_ the Baptist were carried into _Egypt_, and\n",
      "hid in the wall of a Church, _that they might be profitable to future\n",
      "generations_. It was restrained in the reign of _Julian_ the Apostate: and\n",
      "then it spred from _Egypt_ into all the Empire, _Alexandria_ being the\n",
      "Metropolis of the whole world, according to _Chrysostom_, for propagating\n",
      "this sort of devotion, and _Antioch_ and other cities soon following her\n",
      "example.\n",
      "\n",
      "In propagating these superstitions, the ring-leaders were the Monks, and\n",
      "_Antony_ was at the head of them: for in the end of the life of _Antony_,\n",
      "_Athanasius_ relates that these were his dying words to his disciples who\n",
      "then attended him. _Do you take care_, said _Antony_, _to adhere to\n",
      "_Christ_ in the first place, and then to the Saints, that after death they\n",
      "may receive you as friends and acquaintance into the everlasting\n",
      "tabernacles, Think upon these things, perceive these things; and if you\n",
      "have any regard to me, remember me as a father_. This being delivered in\n",
      "charge to the Monks by _Antony_ at his death, A.C. 356, could not but\n",
      "inflame their whole body with devotion towards the Saints, as the ready way\n",
      "to be received, by them into the eternal Tabernacles after death. Hence\n",
      "came that noise about the miracles, done by the reliques of the Saints in\n",
      "the time of _Constantius_: hence came the dispersion of the miracle-working\n",
      "reliques into all the Empire; _Alexandria_ setting the example, and being\n",
      "renowned, for it above all other cities. Hence it came to pass in the days\n",
      "of _Julian_, A.C. 362, that _Athanasius_ by a prophetic spirit, as\n",
      "_Ruffinus_ tells us, hid the bones of _John_ the Baptist from the Heathens,\n",
      "not in the ground to be forgotten, but in the hollow wall of a Church\n",
      "before proper witnesses, that they might _be profitable to future\n",
      "generations_. Hence also came the invocation of the Saints for doing such\n",
      "miracles, and for assisting men in their devotions, and mediating with God.\n",

      "_IrenÃ¦us_ introduced an opinion that the _Apocalypse_ was written in the\n",
      "time of _Domitian_; but then he also postponed the writing of some others\n",
      "of the sacred books, and was to place the _Apocalypse_ after them: he might\n",
      "perhaps have heard from his master _Polycarp_ that he had received this\n",
      "book from _John_ about the time of _Domitian_'s death; or indeed _John_\n",
      "might himself at that time have made a new publication of it, from whence\n",
      "_IrenÃ¦us_ might imagine it was then but newly written. _Eusebius_ in his\n",
      "_Chronicle_ and _Ecclesiastical History_ follows _Irenoeus_; but afterwards\n",
      "[1] in his _Evangelical Demonstrations_, he conjoins the banishment of\n",
      "_John_ into _Patmos_, with the deaths of _Peter_ and _Paul_: and so do [2]\n",
      "_Tertullian_ and _Pseudo-Prochorus_, as well as the first author, whoever\n",
      "he was, of that very antient fable, that _John_ was put by _Nero_ into a\n",
      "vessel of hot oil, and coming out unhurt, was banished by him into\n",
      "_Patmos._ Tho this story be no more than a fiction yet was it founded on a\n",
      "tradition of the first churches, that _John_ was banished into _Patmos_ in\n",
      "the days of _Nero_. _Epiphanius_ represents the _Gospel of John_ as written\n",
      "in the time of _Domitian_, and the _Apocalypse_ even before that of _Nero_.\n",
      "[3] _Arethas_ in the beginning of his Commentary quotes the opinion of\n",
      "_IrenÃ¦us_ from _Eusebius_, but follows it not: for he afterwards affirms\n",
      "the _Apocalypse_ was written before the destruction of _Jerusalem_, and\n",
      "that former commentators had expounded the sixth seal of that destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the opinion of the first Commentators agrees the tradition of the\n",
      "Churches of _Syria_, preserved to this day in the title of the _Syriac_\n",
      "Version of the _Apocalypse_, which title is this: _The Revelation which was\n",
      "made to _John_ the Evangelist by God in the Island _Patmos_, into which he\n",
      "was banished by _Nero_ the _CÃ¦sar__. The fame is confirmed by a story told\n",
      "by [4] _Eusebius_ out of _Clemens Alexandrinus_, and other antient authors,\n",
      "concerning a youth, whom _John_ some time after his return from _Patmos_\n",
      "committed to the care of the Bishop of a certain city. The Bishop educated,\n",
      "instructed, and at length baptized him; but then remitting of his care, the\n",
      "young man thereupon got into ill company, and began by degrees first to\n",
      "revel and grow vitious, then to abuse and spoil those he met in the night;\n",
      "and at last grew so desperate, that his companions turning a band of\n",
      "high-way men, made him their Captain: and, saith [5] _Chrysostom_, he\n",
      "continued their Captain a long time. At length _John_ returning to that\n",
      "city, and hearing what was done, rode to the thief; and, when he out of\n",
      "reverence to his old master fled, _John_ rode after him, recalled him, and\n",
      "restored him to the Church. This is a story of many years, and requires\n",
      "that _John_ should have returned from _Patmos_ rather at the death of\n",
      "_Nero_ than at that of _Domitian_; because between the death of _Domitian_\n",
      "and that of _John_ there were but two years and an half; and _John_ in his\n",
      "old age was [6] so infirm as to be carried to Church, dying above 90 years\n",
      "old, and therefore could not be then suppos'd able to ride after the thief.\n",
      "\n",
      "This opinion is further supported by the allusions in the _Apocalypse_ to\n",
      "the Temple and Altar, and holy City, as then standing; and to the\n",
      "_Gentiles_, who were soon after to tread under foot the holy City and\n",
      "outward Court. 'Tis confirmed also by the style of the _Apocalypse_ itself,\n",
      "which is fuller of _Hebraisms_ than his Gospel. For thence it may be\n",
      "gathered, that it was written when _John_ was newly come out of _Judea_,\n",
      "where he had been used to the _Syriac_ tongue; and that he did not write\n",
      "his Gospel, till by long converse with the _Asiatick_ Greeks he had left\n",
      "off most of the _Hebraisms_. It is confirmed also by the many false\n",
      "_Apocalypses_, as those of _Peter_, _Paul_, _Thomas_, _Stephen_, _Elias_\n",
      "and _Cerinthus_, written in imitation of the true one. For as the many\n",
      "false Gospels, false Acts, and false Epistles were occasioned by true ones;\n",
      "and the writing many false _Apocalypses_, and ascribing them to Apostles\n",
      "and Prophets, argues that there was a true Apostolic one in great request\n",
      "with the first _Christians_: so this true one may well be suppos'd to have\n",
      "been written early, that there may be room in the Apostolic age for the\n",
      "writing of so many false ones afterwards, and fathering them upon _Peter_,\n",
      "_Paul_, _Thomas_ and others, who were dead before _John_. _Caius_, who was\n",
      "contemporary with _Tertullian_, [7] tells us that _Cerinthus_ wrote his\n",
      "Revelations as a great Apostle, and pretended the visions were shewn him by\n",
      "Angels, asserting a _millennium_ of carnal pleasures at _Jerusalem_ after\n",
      "the resurrection; so that his _Apocalypse_ was plainly written in imitation\n",
      "of _John_'s: and yet he lived so early, that [8] he resisted the Apostles\n",
      "at _Jerusalem_ in or before the first year of _Claudius_, that is, 26 years\n",
      "before the death of _Nero_, and [9] died before _John_.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reasons may suffice for determining the time; and yet there is one\n",
      "more, which to considering men may seem a good reason, to others not. I'll\n",
      "propound it, and leave it to every man's judgment. The _Apocalypse_ seems\n",
      "to be alluded to in the Epistles of _Peter_ and that to the _Hebrews_ and\n",
      "therefore to have been written before them. Such allusions in the Epistle\n",
      "to the _Hebrews_, I take to be the discourses concerning the High-Priest in\n",
      "the heavenly Tabernacle, who is both Priest and King, as was _Melchisedec_;\n",
      "and those concerning the _word of God_, with the _sharp two-edged sword_,\n",
      "the [Greek: sabbatismos], or _millennial_ rest, the _earth whose end is to\n",

      "earth, and removing them, that the new heaven, new earth and new kingdom\n",
      "which cannot be shaken, may remain_. In the first of _Peter_ occur these:\n",
      "[10] _The Revelation of Jesus Christ_, twice or thrice repeated; [11] the\n",
      "_blood of _Christ_ as of a Lamb foreordained before the foundation of the\n",

      "man, but holy men of God spake, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\n",
      "Daniel_ [17] himself professes that he understood not his own _Prophecies_;\n",
      "and therefore the Churches were not to expect the interpretation from their\n",
      "Prophet _John_, but to study the Prophecies themselves. This is the\n",
      "substance of what _Peter_ says in the first chapter; and then in the second\n",
      "he proceeds to describe, out of this _sure word of Prophecy_, how there\n",
      "should arise in the Church _false Prophets_, or _false teachers_, expressed\n",
      "collectively in the _Apocalypse_ by the name of the false Prophet; who\n",
      "should _bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought\n",
      "them_, which is the character of _Antichrist_: _And many_, saith he, _shall\n",

      "these are the Merchants of the Earth, who trade with the great Whore, and\n",

      "water_; not such clouds of Saints as the two witnesses ascend in, but\n",
      "_clouds that are carried with a tempest_, &c. Thus does the author of this\n",
      "Epistle spend all the second Chapter in describing the qualities of the\n",
      "_Apocalyptic_ Beasts and false Prophet: and then in the third he goes on to\n",
      "describe their destruction more fully, and the future kingdom. He saith,\n",
      "that because the coming of _Christ_ should be long deferred, they should\n",
      "scoff, saying, _where is the promise of his coming_? Then he describes the\n",
      "sudden coming of the day of the Lord upon them, _as a thief in the night_,\n",
      "which is the _Apocalyptic_ phrase; and the _millennium_, or _thousand\n",

      "_looking for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing therefore _Peter_ and _John_ were Apostles of the circumcision, it\n",
      "seems to me that they staid with their Churches in _Judea_ and _Syria_ till\n",
      "the _Romans_ made war upon their nation, that is, till the twelfth year of\n",
      "_Nero_; that they then followed the main body of their flying Churches into\n",
      "_Asia_, and that _Peter_ went thence by _Corinth_ to _Rome_; that the\n",
      "_Roman_ Empire looked upon those Churches as enemies, because _Jews_ by\n",
      "birth; and therefore to prevent insurrections, secured their leaders, and\n",
      "banished _John_ into _Patmos_. It seems also probable to me that the\n",
      "_Apocalypse_ was there composed, and that soon after the Epistle to the\n",
      "_Hebrews_ and those of _Peter_ were written to these Churches, with\n",
      "reference to this Prophecy as what they were particularly concerned in. For\n",
      "it appears by these Epistles, that they were written in times of general\n",
      "affliction and tribulation under the heathens, and by consequence when the\n",
      "Empire made war upon the _Jews_; for till then the heathens were at peace\n",
      "with the _Christian Jews_, as well as with the rest. The Epistle to the\n",
      "_Hebrews_, since it mentions _Timothy_ as related to those _Hebrews_, must\n",
      "be written to them after their flight into _Asia_, where _Timothy_ was\n",
      "Bishop; and by consequence after the war began, the _Hebrews_ in _Judea_\n",
      "being strangers to _Timothy_. _Peter_ seems also to call _Rome_ _Babylon_,\n",
      "as well with respect to the war made upon _Judea_, and the approaching\n",
      "captivity, like that under old _Babylon_, as with respect to that name in\n",
      "the _Apocalypse_: and in writing _to the strangers scattered thro'out\n",
      "_Pontus_, _Galatia_, _Cappadocia_, _Asia_ and _Bithynia__, he seems to\n",
      "intimate that they were the strangers newly scattered by the _Roman_ wars;\n",
      "for those were the only strangers there belonging to his care.\n",
      "\n",
      "This account of things agrees best with history when duly rectified. For\n",
      "[29] _Justin_ and [30] _IrenÃ¦us_ say, that _Simon Magus_ came to _Rome_ in\n",
      "the reign of _Claudius_, and exercised juggling tricks there.\n",
      "_Pseudo-Clemens_ adds, that he endeavoured there to fly, but broke his neck\n",
      "thro' the prayers of _Peter_. Whence [31] _Eusebius_, or rather his\n",
      "interpolator _Jerom_, has recorded, that _Peter_ came to _Rome_ in the\n",
      "second year of _Claudius_: but [32] _Cyril_ Bishop of _Jerusalem_,\n",
      "_Philastrius_, _Sulpitius_, _Prosper_, _Maximus Taurinensis_, and\n",
      "_Hegesippus junior_, place this victory of _Peter_ in the time of _Nero_.\n",
      "Indeed the antienter tradition was, that _Peter_ came to _Rome_ in the days\n",
      "of this Emperor, as may be seen in [33] _Lactantius_. _Chrysostom_ [34]\n",
      "tells us, that the Apostles continued long in _Judea_, and that then being\n",
      "driven out by the _Jews_ they went to the _Gentiles_. This dispersion was\n",
      "in the first year of the _Jewish_ war, when the _Jews_, as _Josephus_ tells\n",
      "us, began to be tumultuous and violent in all places. For all agree that\n",
      "the Apostles were dispersed into several regions at once; and _Origen_ has\n",
      "set down the time, [35] telling us that in the beginning of the _Judaic_\n",
      "war, the Apostles and disciples of our Lord were scattered into all\n",
      "nations; _Thomas_ into _Parthia_, _Andrew_ into _Scythia_, _John_ into\n",
      "_Asia_, and _Peter_ first into _Asia_, where he preacht to the dispersion,\n",
      "and thence into _Italy_. [36] _Dionysius Corinthius_ saith, that _Peter_\n",
      "went from _Asia_ by _Corinth_ to _Rome_, and all antiquity agrees that\n",
      "_Peter_ and _Paul_ were martyred there in the end of _Nero_'s reign. _Mark_\n",
      "went with _Timothy_ to _Rome_, 2 _Tim._ iv. 11. _Colos._ iv. 10. _Sylvanus_\n",
      "was _Paul_'s assistant; and by the companions of _Peter_, mentioned in his\n",
      "first Epistle, we may know that he wrote from _Rome_; and the Antients\n",
      "generally agree, that in this Epistle he understood _Rome_ by _Babylon_.\n",
      "His second Epistle was writ to the same dispersed strangers with the first,\n",
      "2 _Pet._ iii. 1. and therein he saith, that _Paul_ had writ of the same\n",
      "things to them, and also in his other Epistles, _ver._ 15, 16. Now as there\n",
      "is no Epistle of _Paul_ to these strangers besides that to the _Hebrews_,\n",
      "so in this Epistle, chap. x. 11, 12. we find at large all those things\n",
      "which _Peter_ had been speaking of, and here refers to; particularly the\n",
      "_passing away of the old heavens and earth_, and _establishing an\n",
      "inheritance immoveable_, with an exhortation to grace, because _God_, to\n",
      "the wicked, _is a consuming fire_, Heb. xii. 25, 26, 28, 29.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having determined the time of writing the _Apocalyse_, I need not say much\n",
      "about the truth of it, since it was in such request with the first ages,\n",
      "that many endeavoured to imitate it, by feigning _Apocalypses_ under the\n",
      "Apostles names; and the Apostles themselves, as I have just now shewed,\n",
      "studied it, and used its phrases; by which means the style of the Epistle\n",
      "to the _Hebrews_ became more mystical than that of _Paul_'s other Epistles,\n",
      "and the style of _John_'s Gospel more figurative and majestical than that\n",
      "of the other Gospels. I do not apprehend that _Christ_ was called the word\n",
      "of God in any book of the New Testament written before the _Apocalypse_;\n",
      "and therefore am of opinion, the language was taken from this Prophecy, as\n",
      "were also many other phrases in this Gospel, such as those of _Christ_'s\n",
      "being _the light which enlightens the world, the lamb of God which taketh\n",
      "away the sins of the world, the bridegroom, he that testifieth, he that\n",
      "came down from heaven, the Son of God_, &c. _Justin Martyr_, who within\n",
      "thirty years after _John_'s death became a _Christian_, writes expresly\n",
      "that _a certain man among the _Christians_ whose name was _John_, one of\n",
      "the twelve Apostles of _Christ_, in the Revelation which was shewed him,\n",
      "prophesied that those who believed in _Christ_ should live a thousand years\n",
      "at _Jerusalem__. And a few lines before he saith: _But I, and as many as\n",
      "are _Christians_, in all things right in their opinions, believe both that\n",
      "there shall be a resurrection of the flesh, and a thousand years life at\n",
      "_Jerusalem_ built, adorned and enlarged_. Which is as much as to say, that\n",
      "all true _Christians_ in that early age received this Prophecy: for in all\n",
      "ages, as many as believed the thousand years, received the _Apocalypse_ as\n",
      "the foundation of their opinion: and I do not know one instance to the\n",
      "contrary. _Papias_ Bishop of _Hierapolis_, a man of the Apostolic age, and\n",
      "one of _John_'s own disciples, did not only teach the doctrine of the\n",
      "thousand years, but also [37] asserted the _Apocalypse_ as written by\n",
      "divine inspiration. _Melito_, who flourished next after _Justin_, [38]\n",
      "wrote a commentary upon this Prophecy; and he, being Bishop of _Sardis_ one\n",
      "of the seven Churches, could neither be ignorant of their tradition about\n",
      "it, nor impose upon them. _IrenÃ¦us_, who was contemporary with _Melito_,\n",
      "wrote much upon it, and said, that _the number 666 was in all the antient\n",
      "and approved copies; and that he had it also confirmed to him by those who\n",
      "had seen _John_ face to face_, meaning no doubt his master _Polycarp_ for\n",
      "one. At the same time [39] _Theophilus_ Bishop of _Antioch_ asserted it,\n",
      "and so did _Tertullian_, _Clemens Alexandrinus_, and _Origen_ soon after;\n",
      "and their contemporary _Hippolytus_ the Martyr, Metropolitan of the\n",
      "_Arabians_, [40] wrote a commentary upon it. All these were antient men,\n",
      "flourishing within a hundred and twenty years after _John_'s death, and of\n",
      "greatest note in the Churches of those times. Soon after did _Victorinus\n",
      "Pictaviensis_ write another commentary upon it; and he lived in the time of\n",
      "_Dioclesian_. This may surely suffice to shew how the _Apocalypse_ was\n",
      "received and studied in the first ages: and I do not indeed find any other\n",
      "book of the New Testament so strongly attested, or commented upon so early\n",
      "as this. The Prophecy said: _Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear\n",
      "the words of this Prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein._\n",
      "This animated the first _Christians_ to study it so much, till the\n",
      "difficulty made them remit, and comment more upon the other books of the\n",
      "New Testament. This was the state of the _Apocalypse_, till the thousand\n",
      "years being misunderstood, brought a prejudice against it: and _Dionysius_\n",
      "of _Alexandria_, noting how it abounded with barbarisms, that is with\n",
      "_Hebraisms_, promoted that prejudice so far, as to cause many _Greeks_ in\n",
      "the fourth century to doubt of the book. But whilst the _Latins_, and a\n",
      "great part of the _Greeks_, always retained the _Apocalypse_, and the rest\n",

      "\n",
      "The _Apocalypse_ of _John_ is written in the same style and language with\n",
      "the Prophecies of _Daniel_, and hath the same relation to them which they\n",
      "have to one another, so that all of them together make but one complete\n",
      "Prophecy; and in like manner it consists of two parts, an introductory\n",
      "Prophecy, and an Interpretation thereof.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prophecy is distinguish'd into seven successive parts, by the opening\n",
      "of the seven seals of the book which _Daniel_ was commanded to seal up: and\n",
      "hence it is called the _Apocalypse_ or _Revelation_ of _Jesus Christ_. The\n",
      "time of the seventh seal is sub-divided into eight successive parts by the\n",
      "silence in heaven for half an hour, and the sounding of seven trumpets\n",
      "successively: and the seventh trumpet sounds to the battle of the great day\n",
      "of God Almighty, whereby _the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of\n",
      "the Lord and of his Christ_, and those are destroyed that destroyed the\n",
      "earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Interpretation begins with the words, _And the temple of God was opened\n",
      "in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the Ark of his Testament_: and\n",
      "it continues to the end of the Prophecy. The Temple is the scene of the\n",
      "visions, and the visions in the Temple relate to the feast of the seventh\n",
      "month: for the feasts of the _Jews_ were typical of things to come. The\n",
      "Passover related to the first coming of _Christ_, and the feasts of the\n",
      "seventh month to his second coming: his first coming being therefore over\n",
      "before this Prophecy was given, the feasts of the seventh month are here\n",
      "only alluded unto.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the first day of that month, in the morning, the High-Priest dressed the\n",
      "lamps: and in allusion hereunto, this Prophecy begins with a vision of one\n",
      "like _the Son of man_ in the High-Priest's habit, appearing as it were in\n",
      "the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, or over against the midst of\n",
      "them, dressing the lamps, which appeared like a rod of seven stars in his\n",
      "right hand: and this dressing was perform'd by the sending seven Epistles\n",
      "to the Angels or Bishops of the seven Churches of _Asia_, which in the\n",
      "primitive times illuminated the Temple or Church Catholick. These Epistles\n",
      "contain admonitions against the approaching Apostacy, and therefore relate\n",
      "to the times when the Apostacy began to work strongly, and before it\n",
      "prevailed. It began to work in the Apostles days, and was to continue\n",
      "working _till the man of sin should be revealed_. It began to work in the\n",
      "disciples of _Simon_, _Menander_, _Carpocrates_, _Cerinthas_, and such\n",
      "sorts of men as had imbibed the metaphysical philosophy of the _Gentiles_\n",
      "and _Cabalistical Jews_, and were thence called _Gnosticks_. _John_ calls\n",
      "them _Antichrists_, saying that in his days there were many _Antichrists_.\n",
      "But these being condemned by the Apostles, and their immediate disciples,\n",
      "put the Churches in no danger during the opening of the first four seals.\n",
      "The visions at the opening of these seals relate only to the civil affairs\n",
      "of the heathen _Roman_ Empire. So long the Apostolic traditions prevailed,\n",
      "and preserved the Church in its purity: and therefore the affairs of the\n",
      "Church do not begin to be considered in this Prophecy before the opening of\n",
      "the fifth seal. She began then to decline, and to want admonitions; and\n",
      "therefore is admonished by these Epistles, till the Apostacy prevailed and\n",
      "took place, which was at the opening of the seventh seal. The admonitions\n",
      "therefore in these seven Epistles relate to the state of the Church in the\n",
      "times of the fifth and sixth seals. At the opening of the fifth seal, the\n",
      "Church is purged from hypocrites by a great persecution. At the opening of\n",
      "the sixth, that which letted is taken out of the way, namely the heathen\n",
      "_Roman_ Empire. At the opening of the seventh, the man of sin is revealed.\n",
      "And to these times the seven Epistles relate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seven Angels, to whom these Epistles were written, answer to the seven\n",
      "_Amarc-holim_, who were Priests and chief Officers of the Temple, and had\n",

      "and the direction, appointment and oversight of all things in the Temple.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the lamps were dresed, _John_ saw _the door_ of the Temple _opened_;\n",

      "of that colour. _And_, the Sun being then in the _East, a rainbow was about\n",
      "the throne_, the emblem of glory. _And round about the throne were four and\n",
      "twenty seats_; answering to the chambers of the four and twenty Princes of\n",
      "the Priests, twelve on the south side, and twelve on the north side of the\n",

      "the thundering voices of those that sounded the trumpets, and sung at the\n",
      "Eastern gate of the Priests Court; for these being between _John_ and the\n",

      "of glass clear as chrystal_; the brazen sea between the porch of the Temple\n",
      "and the Altar, filled with clear water. _And in the midst of the throne,\n",
      "and round about the throne, were four Beasts full of eyes before and\n",

      "standing in the four sides of the peoples court. _And the first Beast was\n",
      "like a lion, and the second was like a calf, and the third had the face of\n",
      "a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle_. The people of _Israel_ in\n",
      "the wilderness encamped round about the tabernacle, and on the east side\n",
      "were three tribes under the standard of _Judah_, on the west were three\n",

      "faces with four bodies, one face to every body. The four Beasts are\n",
      "therefore four _Seraphims_ standing in the four sides of the peoples court;\n",
      "the first in the eastern side with the head of a Lion, the second in the\n",
      "western side with the head of an Ox, the third in the southern side with\n",
      "the head of a Man, the fourth in the northern side with the head of an\n",
      "Eagle: and all four signify together the twelve tribes of _Israel_, out of\n",
      "whom the hundred forty and four thousand were sealed, _Apoc._ vii. 4. _And\n",
      "the four Beasts had each of them six wings_, two to a tribe, in all twenty\n",
      "and four wings, answering to the twenty and four stations of the people.\n",
      "_And they were full of eyes within_, or under their wings. _And they rest\n",
      "not day and night_, or at the morning and evening-sacrifices, _saying,\n",
      "holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come_.\n",
      "These animals are therefore the Seraphims, which appeared to _Isaiah_ [1]\n",
      "in a vision like this of the _Apocalypse_. For there also the Lord sat upon\n",
      "a throne in the temple; and the Seraphims each with six wings cried, _Holy,\n",
      "holy, holy Lord God of hosts. And when those animals give glory and honour\n",
      "and thanks to him that sitteth upon the throne, who liveth for ever and\n",
      "ever, the four and twenty Elders_ go into the Temple, and there _fall down\n",

      "honour, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and\n",
      "on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that\n",
      "are in them, heard I, saying, Blessing, honour, glory, and power, be unto\n",
      "him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. And\n",
      "the four Beasts said, _Amen_. And the four and twenty Elders fell down and\n",
      "worshiped him that liveth for ever and ever._ This was the worship of the\n",

      "It was the custom for the High-Priest, seven days before the fast of the\n",
      "seventh month, to continue constantly in the Temple, and study the book of\n",
      "the Law, that he might be perfect in it against the day of expiation;\n",
      "wherein the service, which was various and intricate, was wholly to be\n",
      "performed by himself; part of which service was reading the Law to the\n",
      "people: and to promote his studying it, there were certain Priests\n",
      "appointed by the _Sanhedrim_ to be with him those seven days in one of his\n",
      "chambers in the Temple, and there to discourse with him about the Law, and\n",
      "read it to him, and put him in mind of reading and studying it himself.\n",
      "This his opening and reading the Law those seven days, is alluded unto in\n",
      "the Lamb's opening the seals. We are to conceive that those seven days\n",
      "begin in the evening before each day; for the _Jews_ began their day in the\n",
      "evening, and that the solemnity of the fast begins in the morning of the\n",
      "seventh day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seventh seal was therefore opened on the day of expiation, and then\n",
      "_there was silence in heaven for half an hour. And an Angel_, the\n",
      "High-Priest, _stood at the Altar, having a golden Censer; and there was\n",
      "given him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all\n",
      "Saints, upon the golden Altar which was before the throne_. The custom was\n",
      "on other days, for one of the Priests to take fire from the great Altar in\n",
      "a silver Censer; but on this day, for the High-Priest to take fire from the\n",
      "great Altar in a golden Censer: and when he was come down from the great\n",
      "Altar, he took incense from one of the Priests who brought it to him, and\n",
      "went with it to the golden Altar: and while he offered the incense, the\n",
      "people prayed without in silence, which is the silence in heaven for half\n",
      "an hour. When the High-Priest had laid the incense on the Altar, he carried\n",
      "a Censer of it burning in his hand, into the most holy place before the\n",
      "Ark. _And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the Saints,\n",
      "ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand._ On other days there was a\n",
      "certain measure of incense for the golden Altar: on this day there was a\n",
      "greater quantity for both the Altar and the most holy Place, and therefore\n",
      "it is called _much incense_. After this _the Angel took the Censer, and\n",
      "filled it with fire from the_ great _Altar, and cast it into the earth_;\n",
      "that is, by the hands of the Priests who belong to his mystical body, he\n",
      "cast it to the earth without the Temple, for burning the Goat which was the\n",
      "Lord's lot. _And_ at this and other concomitant sacrifices, until the\n",
      "evening-sacrifice was ended, _there were voices, and thundrings, and\n",
      "lightnings, and an earthquake_; that is, the voice of the High-Priest\n",
      "reading the Law to the people, and other voices and thundrings from the\n",
      "trumpets and temple-musick at the sacrifices, and lightnings from the fire\n",
      "of the Altar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solemnity of the day of expiation being finished, the seven Angels\n",
      "found their trumpets at the great sacrifices of the seven days of the feast\n",
      "of tabernacles; and at the same sacrifices, the seven thunders utter their\n",
      "voices, which are the musick of the Temple, and singing of the _Levites_,\n",
      "intermixed with the soundings of the trumpets: and the seven Angels pour\n",
      "out their vials of wrath, which are the drink-offerings of those\n",
      "sacrifices.\n",

      "When six of the seals were opened, _John_ said: [3] _And after these\n",
      "things_, that is, after the visions of the sixth seal, _I saw four Angels\n",
      "standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the\n",
      "earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on\n",
      "any tree. And I saw another Angel ascending from the _East_, having the\n",
      "seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four Angels,\n",
      "to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the\n",
      "earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our\n",
      "God in their foreheads._ This sealing alludes to a tradition of the _Jews_,\n",
      "that upon the day of expiation all the people of _Israel_ are sealed up in\n",
      "the books of life and death. For the _Jews_ in their _Talmud_ [4] tell us,\n",
      "that in the beginning of every new year, or first day of the month _Tisri_,\n",
      "the seventh month of the sacred year, three books are opened in judgment;\n",
      "the book of life, in which the names of those are written who are perfectly\n",
      "just; the book of death, in which the names of those are written who are\n",
      "Atheists or very wicked; and a third book, of those whose judgment is\n",
      "suspended till the day of expiation, and whose names are not written in the\n",
      "book of life or death before that day. The first ten days of this month\n",
      "they call the penitential days; and all these days they fast and pray very\n",
      "much, and are very devout, that on the tenth day their sins may be\n",
      "remitted, and their names may be written in the book of life; which day is\n",
      "therefore called the day of expiation. And upon this tenth day, in\n",
      "returning home from the Synagogues, they say to one another, _God the\n",
      "creator seal you to a good year_. For they conceive that the books are now\n",
      "sealed up, and that the sentence of God remains unchanged henceforward to\n",
      "the end of the year. The same thing is signified by the two Goats, upon\n",
      "whose foreheads the High-Priest yearly, on the day of expiation, lays the\n",
      "two lots inscribed, _For God_ and _For _Azazel__; God's lot signifying the\n",
      "people who are sealed with the name of God in their foreheads; and the lot\n",
      "_Azazel_, which was sent into the wilderness, representing those who\n",
      "receive the mark and name of the Beast, and go into the wilderness with the\n",
      "great Whore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The servants of God being therefore sealed in the day of expiation, we may\n",
      "conceive that this sealing is synchronal to the visions which appear upon\n",
      "opening the seventh seal; and that when the Lamb had opened six of the\n",
      "seals and seen the visions relating to the inside of the sixth, he looked\n",
      "on the backside of the seventh leaf, and then saw _the four Angels holding\n",
      "the four winds of heaven, and another Angel ascending from the _East_ with\n",
      "the seal of God_. Conceive also, that the Angels which held the four winds\n",
      "were the first four of the seven Angels, who upon opening the seventh seal\n",
      "were seen standing before God; and that upon their holding the winds,\n",
      "_there was silence in heaven for half an hour_; and that while the servants\n",
      "of God were sealing, the Angel with the golden Censer offered their prayers\n",
      "with incense upon the golden Altar, and read the Law: and that so soon as\n",
      "they were sealed, the winds hurt the earth at the sounding of the first\n",
      "trumpet, and the sea at the sounding of the second; these winds signifying\n",
      "the wars, to which the first four trumpets sounded. For as the first four\n",
      "seals are distinguished from the three last by the appearance of four\n",
      "horsemen towards the four winds of heaven; so the wars of the first four\n",
      "trumpets are distinguished from those of the three last, by representing\n",
      "these by _four winds_, and the others by _three great woes_.\n",

      "upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations\n",
      "done in the midst thereof_: and then the six men, like the Angels of the\n",

      "Eastern gate of the Priests court, and read the Law to the people, while\n",
      "the Heifer and the Goat which was the Lord's lot, were burning without the\n",

      "book spread open before him, and written within and without, full of\n",
      "lamentations and mourning and woe, but sweet in his mouth. Eating and\n",

      "vigorous and extraordinary manner with the Prophecy of the whole book, and\n",
      "therefore signifies a lively repetition of the whole Prophecy by way of\n",
      "interpretation, and begins not till the first Prophecy, that of the seals\n",
      "and trumpets, is ended. It was sweet in _John_'s mouth, and therefore\n",
      "begins not with the bitter Prophecy of the _Babylonian_ captivity, and the\n",
      "_Gentiles_ being in the outward court of the Temple, and treading the holy\n",
      "city under foot; and the prophesying of the _two Witnesses_ in sackcloth,\n",

      "the sweet Prophecy of the glorious _Woman in heaven_, and the victory of\n",

      "Temple called the separate place, and the square court of the Altar called\n",

      "building of a second Temple, for those that are sealed out of all the\n",
      "twelve tribes of _Israel_, and worship in the inward court of sincerity and\n",
      "truth: but _John_ is commanded to leave out the outward court, or outward\n",

      "_Babylonian Gentiles_. For the glorious woman in heaven, the remnant of\n",
      "whole seed kept the commandments of God, and had the testimony of _Jesus_,\n",
      "continued the same woman in outward form after her flight into the\n",
      "wilderness, whereby she quitted her former sincerity and piety, and became\n",
      "the great Whore. She lost her chastity, but kept her outward form and\n",
      "shape. And while the _Gentiles_ tread the holy city underfoot, and worship\n",
      "in the outward court, the two witnesses, represented perhaps by the two\n",
      "feet of the Angel standing on the sea and earth, prophesied against them,\n",

      "begins the Interpretation thereof with these words, _And the Temple of God\n",

      "Testament_. By the Ark, we may know that this was the first Temple; for the\n",
      "second Temple had no Ark. _And there were lightnings, and voices, and\n",

      "the _Roman_ Empire, during the reign of the four horsemen, who appeared\n",
      "upon opening the first four seals. _And there appeared a great wonder in\n",
      "heaven, a woman clothed with the Sun_. In the Prophecy, the affairs of the\n",
      "Church begin to be considered at the opening of the fifth seal; and in the\n",
      "Interpretation, they begin at the same time with the vision of the Church\n",
      "in the form of a woman in heaven: there she is persecuted, and here she is\n",
      "pained in travail. The Interpretation proceeds down first to the sealing of\n",
      "the servants of God, and marking the rest with the mark of the Beast; and\n",
      "then to the day of judgment, represented by a harvest and vintage. Then it\n",
      "returns back to the times of opening the seventh seal, and interprets the\n",
      "Prophecy of the seven trumpets by the pouring out of seven vials of wrath.\n",
      "The Angels who pour them out, come out of the _Temple of the Tabernacle_;\n",
      "that is, out of the second Temple, for the Tabernacle had no outward court.\n",

      "_Of the relation which the Prophecy of _John_ hath to those of _Daniel_;\n",
      "and of the Subject of the Prophecy_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole scene of sacred Prophecy is composed of three principal parts:\n",
      "the regions beyond _Euphrates_, represented by the two first Beasts of\n",
      "_Daniel_; the Empire of the _Greeks_ on this side of _Euphrates_,\n",
      "represented by the Leopard and by the He-Goat; and the Empire of the\n",
      "_Latins_ on this side of _Greece_, represented by the Beast with ten horns.\n",
      "And to these three parts, the phrases of the _third part of the earth, sea,\n",
      "rivers, trees, ships, stars, sun, and moon_, relate. I place the body of\n",
      "the fourth Beast on this side of _Greece_, because the three first of the\n",
      "four Beasts had their lives prolonged after their dominion was taken away,\n",
      "and therefore belong not to the body of the fourth. He only stamped them\n",
      "with his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the _earth_, the _Jews_ understood the great continent of all _Asia_ and\n",
      "_Africa_, to which they had access by land: and by the Isles of the _sea_,\n",
      "they understood the places to which they sailed by sea, particularly all\n",
      "_Europe_: and hence in this Prophecy, the _earth_ and _sea_ are put for the\n",
      "nations of the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third and fourth Beasts of _Daniel_ are the same with the Dragon and\n",
      "ten-horned Beast of _John_, but with this difference: _John_ puts the\n",
      "Dragon for the whole _Roman_ Empire while it continued entire, because it\n",
      "was entire when that Prophecy was given; and the Beast he considers not\n",
      "till the Empire became divided: and then he puts the Dragon for the Empire\n",
      "of the _Greeks_, and the Beast for the Empire of the _Latins_. Hence it is\n",
      "that the Dragon and Beast have common heads and common horns: but the\n",
      "Dragon hath crowns only upon his heads, and the Beast only upon his horns;\n",
      "because the Beast and his horns reigned not before they were divided from\n",
      "the Dragon: and when the Dragon gave the Beast his throne, the ten horns\n",
      "received power as Kings, the same hour with the Beast. The heads are seven\n",
      "successive Kings. Four of them were the four horsemen which appeared at the\n",
      "opening of the first four seals. In the latter end of the sixth head, or\n",
      "seal, considered as present in the visions, it is said, _five_ of the seven\n",
      "Kings _are fallen, and one is, and another is not yet come; and the Beast\n",
      "that was and is not_, being wounded to death with a sword, _he is the\n",
      "eighth, and of the seven_: he was therefore a collateral part of the\n",
      "seventh. The horns are the same with those of _Daniel_'s fourth Beast,\n",
      "described above.\n",

      "The four horsemen which appear at the opening of the first four seals, have\n",

      "_And none was found worthy to open the book_ till the Lamb of God appeared;\n",
      "the great High-Priest represented by a lamb slain at the foot of the Altar\n",
      "in the morning-sacrifice. _And he came, and took the book out of the hand\n",
      "of him that sat upon the throne._ For the High-Priest, in the feast of the\n",
      "seventh month, went into the most holy place, and took the book of the law\n",
      "out of the right side of the Ark, to read it to the people: and in order to\n",
      "read it well, he studied it seven days, that is, upon the fourth, fifth,\n",
      "sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth days, being attended by some of the\n",
      "priests to hear him perform. These seven days are alluded to, by the Lamb's\n",
      "opening the seven seals successively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the tenth day of the month, a young bullock was offered for a\n",
      "sin-offering for the High-Priest, and a goat for a sin-offering for the\n",
      "people: and lots were cast upon two goats to determine which of them should\n",
      "be God's lot for the sin-offering; and the other goat was called _Azazel_,\n",
      "the scape-goat. The High-Priest in his linen garments, took a censer full\n",
      "of burning coals of fire from the Altar, his hand being full of sweet\n",
      "incense beaten small; and went into the most holy place within the veil,\n",
      "and put the incense upon the fire, and sprinkled the blood of the bullock\n",
      "with his finger upon the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat seven times;\n",
      "and then he killed the goat which fell to God's lot, for a sin-offering for\n",
      "the people, and brought his blood within the veil, and sprinkled it also\n",
      "seven times upon the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat. Then he went out\n",
      "to the Altar, and sprinkled it also seven times with the blood of the\n",
      "bullock, and as often with the blood of the goat. After this _he laid both\n",
      "his hands upon the head of the live goat; and confessed over him all the\n",
      "iniquities of the children of _Israel_, and all their transgressions in all\n",
      "their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat; and sent him away into\n",
      "the wilderness by the hands of a fit man: and the goat bore upon him all\n",
      "their iniquities into a land not inhabited_, Levit. chap. iv. & chap. xvi.\n",
      "While the High-Priest was doing these things in the most holy place and at\n",
      "the Altar, the people continued at their devotion quietly and in silence.\n",
      "Then the High-Priest went into the holy place, put off his linen garments,\n",
      "and put on other garments; then came out, and sent the bullock and the goat\n",
      "of the sin-offering to be burnt without the camp, with fire taken in a\n",
      "censer from the Altar: and as the people returned home from the Temple,\n",
      "they said to one another, _God seal you to a good new year_.\n",
      "\n",
      "In allusion to all this, _when he had opened the seventh seal, there was\n",
      "silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. And an Angel stood at\n",
      "the Altar having a golden Censer, and there was given unto him much\n",
      "incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all Saints, upon the\n",
      "golden Altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense with\n",
      "the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand.\n",
      "And the Angel took the Censer, and filled it with fire of the Altar, and\n",
      "cast it to the earth_, suppose without the camp, for sacrificing the goat\n",
      "which fell to God's lot. For the High-Priest being _Christ_ himself, the\n",
      "bullock is omitted. At this sacrifice _there were voices and thundrings_,\n",
      "of the musick of the Temple, _and lightnings_ of the sacred fire, _and an\n",
      "earthquake_: and synchronal to these things was the sealing of _the 144000\n",
      "out of all the twelve tribes of the children of _Israel_ with the seal of\n",
      "God in their foreheads_, while the rest of the twelve tribes received the\n",
      "mark of the Beast, and the Woman fled from the Temple into the wilderness\n",
      "to her place upon this Beast. For this sealing and marking was represented\n",
      "by casting lots upon the two goats, sacrificing God's lot on mount _Sion_,\n",
      "and sending the scape-goat into the wilderness loaden with the sins of the\n",
      "people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the fifteenth day of the month, and the six following days, there were\n",
      "very great sacrifices. And in allusion to the sounding of trumpets, and\n",
      "singing with thundring voices, and pouring out drink-offerings at those\n",
      "sacrifices, _seven trumpets are sounded_, and _seven thunders utter their\n",
      "voices_, and _seven vials of wrath are poured out_. Wherefore the sounding\n",
      "of the _seven trumpets_, the voices of the _seven thunders_, and the\n",
      "pouring out of the _seven vials of wrath_, are synchronal, and relate to\n",
      "one and the same division of the time of the seventh seal following the\n",
      "silence, into seven successive parts. The seven days of this feast were\n",
      "called the feast of Tabernacles; and during these seven days the children\n",
      "of _Israel_ dwelt in booths, and rejoiced with palm-branches in their\n",
      "hands. To this alludes _the multitude with palms in their hands_, which\n",
      "appeared after the sealing of the 144000, and _came out of the great\n",
      "tribulation_ with triumph at the battle of the great day, to which the\n",
      "seventh trumpet sounds. The visions therefore of the 144000, and of the\n",
      "palm-bearing multitude, extend to the sounding of the seventh trumpet, and\n",
      "therefore are synchronal to the times of the seventh seal.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the 144000 _are sealed out of all the twelve tribes of _Israel__, and\n",
      "the rest receive _the mark of the Beast_, and thereby the first temple is\n",
      "destroyed; _John_ is bidden to _measure the temple and altar_, that is,\n",
      "their courts, _and them that worship therein_, that is, the 144000 standing\n",
      "on mount _Sion_ and on the sea of glass: _but the court that is without the\n",
      "temple_, that is, the peoples court, to _leave out and measure it not,\n",
      "because it is given to the_ Gentiles, those who receive the mark of the\n",
      "Beast; _and the holy city they shall tread under foot forty and two\n",
      "months_, that is, all the time that the Beast acts under the woman\n",
      "_Babylon_: and _the two witnesses prophesy 1260 days_, that is, all the\n",
      "same time, _clothed in sackcloth. These have power_, like _Elijah, to shut\n",
      "heaven that it rain not_, at the sounding of the first trumpet; and, like\n",
      "_Moses, to turn the waters into blood_ at the sounding of the second; _and\n",
      "to smite the earth with all plagues_, those of the trumpets, _as often as\n",
      "they will_. These prophesy at the building of the second temple, like\n",
      "_Haggai_ and _Zechary_. These are _the two Olive-trees_, or Churches, which\n",
      "_supplied the lamps with oil_, _Zech._ iv. These are _the two\n",
      "candlesticks_, or Churches, _standing before the God of the earth_. Five of\n",
      "the seven Churches of _Asia_, those in prosperity, are found fault with,\n",
      "and exhorted to repent, and threatned to be _removed out of their places_,\n",
      "or _spewed out of _Christ's_ mouth_, or _punished with the sword of\n",

      "state of persecution, to illuminate the second temple. When the primitive\n",

      "into the _Greek_ and _Latin_ Empires, the Beast is included in the body of\n",
      "the Dragon; and from the time of that division, the Beast is the _Latin_\n",
      "Empire only. Hence the Dragon and Beast have the same heads and horns; but\n",
      "the heads are crowned upon the Dragon, and the horns upon the Beast. The\n",
      "horns are ten kingdoms, into which the Beast becomes divided presently\n",
      "after his separation from the Dragon, as hath been described above. The\n",
      "heads are seven successive dynasties, or parts, into which the _Roman_\n",
      "Empire becomes divided by the opening of the seven seals. Before the woman\n",
      "fled into the wilderness, _she being with child_ of a Christian Empire,\n",
      "_cried travelling_, viz. in the ten years persecution of _Dioclesian_, _and\n",
      "pained to be delivered: and the Dragon_, the heathen _Roman_ Empire, _stood\n",
      "before her, to devour her child as soon as it was born. And she brought\n",
      "forth a man child, who_ at length _was to rule all nations with a rod of\n",
      "iron. And her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne_ in the\n",

      "the woman fled_ from the Temple _into the wilderness_ of _Arabia_ to\n",
      "_Babylon_, _where she hath a place_ of riches and honour and dominion, upon\n",
      "the back of the Beast, _prepared of God, that they should feed her there\n",
      "1260 days. And there was war in heaven_, between the heathens under\n",
      "_Maximinus_ and the new Christian Empire; _and the great Dragon was cast\n",
      "out, that old serpent, which deceiveth the whole world_, the spirit of\n",
      "heathen idolatry; _he was cast out_ of the throne _into the earth. And they\n",
      "overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony;\n",

      "\n",
      "_And when the Dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the\n",

      "against her in the reign of _Licinius_. _And to the woman_, by the building\n",
      "of _Constantinople_ and equalling it to _Rome_, _were given two wings of a\n",
      "great eagle, that she might flee into the wilderness into her place_ upon\n",
      "the back of her Beast, _where she is nourished for a time, and times, and\n",
      "half a time, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent_, upon the death\n",
      "of _Constantine_ the great, _cast out of his mouth water as a flood_, viz.\n",
      "the _Western_ Empire under _Constantine junior_ and _Constans_, _after the\n",
      "woman: that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the\n",
      "earth_, the nations of _Asia_ now under _Constantinople_, _helped the\n",
      "woman_; and by conquering the _Western_ Empire, now under _Magnentius_,\n",
      "_swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth. And the\n",

      "_Jesus Christ_, which_ in that war _were sealed out of all the twelve\n",

      "four Beasts in order, putting his Beast in the room of _Daniel_'s fourth\n",
      "Beast, to shew that they are the same. _And the Dragon gave_ this Beast\n",
      "_his power and his seat and great authority_, by relinquishing the\n",
      "_Western_ Empire to him. _And one of his heads_, the sixth, was _as it were\n",
      "wounded to death_, viz. by the sword of the earth, which swallowed up the\n",
      "waters cast out of the mouth of the Dragon; _and his deadly wound was\n",
      "healed_, by a new division of the Empire between _Valentinian_ and\n",
      "_Valens_, _An._ 364. _John_ saw the Beast rise out of the sea, at the\n",
      "division thereof between _Gratian_ and _Theodosius_, _An._ 379. The Dragon\n",
      "gave the Beast his power, and his seat and great authority, at the death of\n",
      "_Theodosius_, when _Theodosius_ gave the _Western_ Empire to his son\n",
      "_Honorius_. After which the two Empires were no more united: but the\n",
      "_Western_ Empire became presently divided into ten kingdoms, as above; and\n",
      "these kingdoms at length united in religion under the woman, and reign with\n",
      "her _forty and two months_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_And I beheld_, saith _John_, _another Beast coming up out of the earth._\n",
      "When the woman fled from the Dragon into the kingdom of the Beast, and\n",
      "became his Church, this other Beast rose up out of the earth, to represent\n",
      "the Church of the Dragon. For _he had two horns like the Lamb_, such as\n",
      "were the bishopricks of _Alexandria_ and _Antioch_: _and he spake as the\n",
      "Dragon_ in matters of religion: _and he causeth the earth_, or nations of\n",
      "the Dragon's kingdom, _to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was\n",
      "healed_, that is, to be of his religion. _And he doth great wonders, so\n",
      "that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of\n",
      "men_; that is, he excommunicateth those who differ from him in point of\n",
      "religion: for in pronouncing their excommunications, they used to swing\n",
      "down a lighted torch from above. _And he said to them that dwell on the\n",
      "earth, that they should make an image to the Beast, which had the wound by\n",
      "a sword, and did live_; that is, that they should call a Council of men of\n",
      "the religion of this Beast. _And he had power to give life unto the image\n",
      "of the Beast, that the image of the Beast should both speak, and cause that\n",
      "as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed_, viz.\n",
      "mystically, by dissolving their Churches. _And he causeth all both small\n",
      "and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right\n",
      "band or in their foreheads, and that no man might buy or sell, save he that\n",
      "had the mark, or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name_; that\n",
      "is, the mark [Cross], or the name [Greek: LATEINOS], or the number thereof\n",
      "[Greek: chxs], 666. All others were excommunicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the seven Angels had poured out the seven vials of wrath, and _John_\n",
      "had described them all in the present time, he is called up from the time\n",
      "of the seventh vial to the time of the sixth seal, to take a view of the\n",
      "woman and her Beast, who were to reign in the times of the seventh seal. In\n",
      "respect of the latter part of time of the sixth seal, then considered as\n",
      "present, the Angel tells _John_: _The Beast that thou sawest, was and is\n",
      "not, and shall ascend out of the abyss, and go into perdition_; that is, he\n",
      "was in the reign of _Constans_ and _Magnentius_, until _Constantius_\n",
      "conquered _Magnentius_, and re-united the _Western_ Empire to the\n",
      "_Eastern_. He is not during the reunion, and he shall ascend out of the\n",
      "abyss or sea at a following division of the Empire. The Angel tells him\n",
      "further: _Here is the mind which hath wisdom: the seven heads are seven\n",
      "mountains, on which the woman sitteth_; _Rome_ being built upon seven\n",
      "hills, and thence called the seven-hilled city. _Also there are seven\n",
      "Kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when\n",
      "he cometh, he must continue a short space: and the Beast that was and is\n",
      "not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition_.\n",
      "Five are fallen, the times of the five first seals being past; and one is,\n",
      "the time of the sixth seal being considered as present; and another is not\n",
      "yet come, and when he cometh, which will be at the opening of the seventh\n",
      "seal, he must continue a short space: and the Beast that was and is not,\n",
      "even he is the eighth, by means of the division of the _Roman_ Empire into\n",
      "two collateral Empires; and is of the seven, being one half of the seventh,\n",
      "and shall go into perdition. The words, _five are fallen, and one is, and\n",
      "the other is not yet come_, are usually referred by interpreters to the\n",
      "time of _John_ the Apostle, when the Prophecy was given: but it is to be\n",
      "considered, that in this Prophecy many things are spoken of as present,\n",
      "which were not present when the Prophecy was given, but which would be\n",
      "present with respect to some future time, considered as present in the\n",
      "visions. Thus where it is said upon pouring out the seventh vial of wrath,\n",
      "that _great _Babylon_ came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the\n",
      "cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath_; this relates not to the\n",
      "time of _John_ the Apostle, but to the time of pouring out the seventh vial\n",
      "of wrath. So where it is said, _Babylon is fallen, is fallen_; and _thrust\n",
      "in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come for thee to reap_; and _the\n",
      "time of the dead is come, that they should be judged_; and again, _I saw\n",
      "the dead small and great stand before God_: these sayings relate not to the\n",
      "days of _John_ the Apostle, but to the latter times considered as present\n",
      "in the visions. In like manner the words, _five are fallen, and one is, and\n",
      "the other is not yet come_, and _the Beast that was and is not, he is the\n",
      "eighth_, are not to be referred to the age of _John_ the Apostle, but\n",
      "relate to the time when the Beast was to be wounded to death with a sword,\n",
      "and shew that this wound was to be given him in his sixth head: and without\n",
      "this reference we are not told in what head the Beast was wounded. _And the\n",
      "ten horns which thou sawest, are ten Kings, which have received no kingdom\n",
      "as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast. These have one\n",
      "mind_, being all of the whore's religion, _and shall give their power and\n",
      "strength unto the Beast. These shall make war with the Lamb_, at the\n",
      "sounding of the seventh trumpet; _and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he\n",
      "is Lord of Lords and King of Kings; and they that are with him are called\n",
      "and chosen and faithful. And he saith unto me, the waters which thou sawest\n",
      "where the whore sitteth, are peoples and multitudes and nations and\n",
      "tongues_, composing her Beast. _And the ten horns which thou sawest upon\n",
      "the Beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and\n",
      "naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire_, at the end of the\n",
      "1260 days. _For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to\n",
      "agree and give their kingdom unto the Beast, until the words of God shall\n",
